1942 (Cwth) and its successor, s 206 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cwth), which deem publications\nby the electronic media of radio and television to be publications in a permanent form, enact a fictional situation solely in order to render defamatory statements so\npublished libel rather than slander (and thus avoid the need for proof of special damage).

An implication is included in and is part of that which is expressed by the publisher. It is\nsomething which the reader (or listener or viewer) understands the publisher as having intended to say. An inference is something which the reader (or listener or viewer)\nadds to what is stated by the publisher; it may reasonably or even irresistibly follow from what has been expressly or impliedly said, but it is nevertheless a conclusion\ndrawn by the reader (or listener or viewer) from what has been expressly or impliedly said by the publisher. It is the reader's (or listener's or viewer's) own conclusion.\nLubrano v Gollin & Co Pty Ltd [1919] HCA 61; (1919) 27 CLR 113; Rose v Hvric [1963] HCA 13; (1963) 108 CLR 353; Bargold Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1981] 1\nNSWLR 9; Harrison v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1981] 1 NSWLR 620 followed\nMirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison [1982] HCA 50; (1982) 149 CLR 293 referred to\n(7) The publisher is not held responsible for an inference which the ordinary reasonable reader (or listener or viewer) has drawn from an inference already drawn from the\nmatter complained of because it is unreasonable for the publisher to be held so responsible.\nLewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234; Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison [1982] HCA 50; (1982) 149 CLR 293 followed\n(8) There is no unreasonableness involved in making the publisher responsible for an inference drawn by the ordinary reasonable reader (or listener or viewer) from a\nstatement which the publisher is reasonably understood to have intended to imply in the matter complained of.\n(9) Where the publisher invites the adoption of a suspicious approach, it is reasonable for the publisher to be responsible for at least some conclusions reached for which it\nwould not otherwise have been reasonable to make the publisher responsible. A degree of conjecture or guesswork is therefore permitted which would not otherwise be\npermitted. However, the requirement of reasonableness still applies. The publisher is not responsible for every conclusion which may have been reached by such conjecture\nor guesswork.\nJones v Skelton (1963) 63 SR 644 explained\n(10) The application of these principles must keep up with the techniques of defamation by modern media communications, but the principles themselves remain\nunchanged. In the end, the test remains one of reasonableness - whether it is reasonable to hold the publisher responsible for a conclusion which is not reasonably\nunderstood to have been expressed or implied by what the publisher has said, but which the ordinary reasonable reader (or listener or viewer) has drawn for himself or\nherself, perhaps by having taken into account his or own beliefs which have been excited by what was published. That is fundamental to the publisher's responsibility. If the\npublisher does anything which makes it reasonable for him to be held responsible for something more (such as by an invitation to speculate), then he is made responsible\nfor it.\n(11) An imputation must be pleaded with sufficient precision as to avoid the likelihood of confusion either at the pleading stage or at the trial in relation to the meaning for\nwhich the plaintiff contends.\nWhelan v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 148; Drummoyne Municipal Council v ABC (1990) 21 NSWLR 136; Rigby v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Court of\nAppeal, 1 February 1996, unreported) [SLAR] followed\nORDERS\n1.

It is internally described as a \"major investigation\" into \"under age sex in Sydney\"\n. In brief, it commences by referring to what is said to have been the dismissal\nby the High Court of an appeal by the plaintiff, thus enabling the defendant to go ahead and screen its \"major investigation\"\n.[1] The report of this investigation comprises\ntwo parts, divided by a commercial break lasting three and a half minutes.[2] What is described as the \"first part\" of the report is described as dealing with the \"disturbing\nand often graphic stories of victims ready to turn their shame and anger into justice\"\n, and it consists of interviews with three boys (who had signed statutory declarations as\nto the truth of their stories) and with a man who says that he had been the barman at \"Costello's\"\n- said to have been the \"most notorious\" of the \"main centres of\npaedophile activity in the Kings Cross of the 70's and early 80's\"\n.\nThe narrator says:\n\"This is a story that won't just fuel the public outrage about paedophile activity. It will also send shock waves through the establishment. For tonight we'll examine the\nbehaviour of a man with friends in the highest places. His name is John Marsden, the President of the Council for Civil Liberties, former head of the New South Wales Law\nSociety, former member of the New South Wales Police Board and, say his accusers, a paedophile.\n\"[3]\nThe plaintiff's statements from an earlier television programme are replayed - that he had \"never had sex with anyone under age\"\n, and that \"[a]s far as I know, I have never\never slept with someone under age\"\n. All three boys identify the plaintiff as having had \"sex\" with them when they were fourteen or fifteen years of age or \"under age\"\n, and\nthe barman says that he has seen the plaintiff with \"young prostitutes\" around the Cross and with \"kid[s]\" at Costello's. After referring to allegations made against the\nplaintiff earlier in Parliament, and the determination by the Director of Public Prosecutions that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him, the narrator continues:\n\"Marsden claimed he had been cleared. ... But tonight's story should cause many in public life to rethink their support for Marsden.\n\"\nThe first part of the investigation report concludes by the narrator pointing out that the plaintiff was \"not the only patron of Costello's who liked boys\"\n. The owner of that\nclub, a man named Johnny McLean, is described as \"a pervert whose awful legacy lives on ...\n\"\n-\n\"\n... for, as we'll see in part two of our story, among those he corrupted as children were the Murphy brothers who went on to commit one of Australia's worst crimes. The\nbrutal murder in 1986 of the nurse and former beauty queen, Anita Cobby.\n\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a5eedd3-493f-4291-8003-481967be74fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a5eedd3-493f-4291-8003-481967be74fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ec8e1fa-7611-44c0-b8c2-f31332defce3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5658d51ec1d58a9c277e4d4299cb323dec37128060798b8a13d1cef4eb898523"}, "3": {"node_id": "384de575-b185-4cd9-b9a5-f7339dbc561b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a246cfe5c5940759ca6f0e1bfc25ca66c65b0f892a8d9f600aa3012a7c5629b7"}}, "hash": "e22bddda2f1c0daaeafc3faa9814bb72a39bf070c6fe5a9b5de526ff9fb02a74", "text": "After the commercial break, the investigation \"continues\"\n, and its \"implications\" are said to \"become far more disturbing\":\n\"Not only has abuse by Sydney men destroyed lives and minds, but it's created people capable of the most horrific crimes, including the murder of Anita Cobby.\n\"\nSex with boys at Costello's is described by one of the boys earlier interviewed, and by both the barman and the doorman of that club. The investigation report goes into\nsome detail of the activities of McLean, and of a man named Tony Bevan who is described as the former mayor of Wollongong (both men are said to be now dead), and of a\nman named Joe Westwood (who is said to be still alive and living in Queensland). The treatment afforded to a young boy named Les Murphy and his brothers (all\nsubsequently convicted of the rape and murder of Anita Cobby) is described in detail by various people (including their brother Patrick), and very much less detailed\nreference is made to the conduct afforded to another young boy named Andrew Tregurtha, who was convicted of killing two of his clients at the age of sixteen. The narrator\nconcludes his part in the investigation report by asserting that those whose bodies have been corrupted have been left with corrupted values. It is, he says:\n\"\n... all part of an appalling legacy - the betrayal of trust, the shattered dreams, the lives wasted by drugs and self loathing.\n\"\nThe youth worker interviewed during the investigation says that the community has paid a very high price for having ignored and neglected the pleas of these boys. The boy\nwho appears in both parts of the investigation report, and who wonders what he is capable of doing as a result of the anger inside him, says that society does not need\nmore people like him and others walking around.\nInstead of pleading any imputation that he is a pederast (or containing some more precise definition of what that word encompasses), the plaintiff has elected to plead six\nimputations expressed in terms that he has committed criminal offences:\n\"(a) The plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual intercourse with boys who were under the age of sixteen, knowing them to be under the age of sixteen.\n(b) The plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual intercourse with boys who were under the age of sixteen, with reckless indifference as to whether they\nwere under the age of sixteen.\n(c) The plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual intercourse with boys who were under the age of sixteen.\n(d) The plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual intercourse with male prostitutes who were fifteen years of age, knowing them to be under the age of\nsixteen.\n(e) The plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual intercourse with male prostitutes who were fifteen years of age, with reckless indifference as to whether\nthey were fifteen years of age.\n(f) The plaintiff has committed criminal offences by having sexual intercourse with a [sic] male prostitutes who were fifteen years of age.\n\"\nThe significance of the differing ages of fifteen and sixteen years, and of the departure from what may be thought to be the usual ages of ten or eighteen years expressed in\nthe current statute,[4] is unclear, and the specific criminal offences said to have been imputed are not identified.[5] No complaint in relation to this curious form of pleading\nis before this Court.\nThe only issues raised in this appeal relate to imputations (g) and (h), which are in the following terms:\n\"(g) The plaintiff caused the rape and murder of Anita Cobby by Lesley Murphy in that he was one of a number of men who had anal intercourse with Murphy when he was\nunder thirteen years of age which acts caused Murphy such grave psychiatric damage that he raped and murdered Ms Cobby.\n(h) The plaintiff caused the murders of two men by Andrew Tregurtha in that he was one of a number of men who subjected Tregurtha to inhuman and degrading acts of\nphysical sexual abuse when he was a child which acts caused Tregurtha such grave psychiatric damage that he committed the two murders.\n\"\nAlthough no objection had been taken before Levine J to the form in which these imputations have been pleaded, such an objection was taken in this Court after queries as\nto whether that form was appropriate had been raised by the members of the Court.\nThe form of an imputation\nThe importance of some precision in the pleading of the plaintiff's imputation lies primarily in the fact that, by virtue of s 9(2) of the Defamation Act 1974, each imputation\nhas now become a separate cause of action to which the defendant must plead.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "384de575-b185-4cd9-b9a5-f7339dbc561b": {"__data__": {"id_": "384de575-b185-4cd9-b9a5-f7339dbc561b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a5eedd3-493f-4291-8003-481967be74fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e22bddda2f1c0daaeafc3faa9814bb72a39bf070c6fe5a9b5de526ff9fb02a74"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a139754-0afe-495e-a447-2ad8f84f3cb9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b74d528d7ec3c574a843ef3a54377a0b28f9dba1932355fea42d6b6fca59f71"}}, "hash": "a246cfe5c5940759ca6f0e1bfc25ca66c65b0f892a8d9f600aa3012a7c5629b7", "text": "[6] It is a fundamental rule that the defendant in any proceedings is entitled to know the\nnature of the case to which he must plead and which he will be called upon to meet at the trial.[7] If there is likely to be confusion in a defamation action either at the\npleading stage or at the trial as to the meaning for which the plaintiff contends, the defendant is necessarily embarrassed.[8] Part 15 r 26(1)(b) permits the striking out of any\npleading (or part thereof) which has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay in the proceedings.\nThere has been a lot said over the years in relation to the need for precision in the pleading of imputations in defamation actions, not all of it consistent. The history of the\ndiffering views taken by this Court may be traced, for those who are interested, in a number of first instance decisions of mine.[9] It is now safe to say that this Court has\nonce again re-affirmed its earlier stand,[10] that an imputation must be stated with sufficient precision as to avoid the likelihood of confusion in relation to the meaning for\nwhich the plaintiff contends.[11]\nThe form in which each of the two imputations in issue in this appeal has been pleaded was (we were informed) designed to overcome any imprecision of the word\n\"caused\" - so that, if the jury accept that the ordinary reasonable viewer of the telecast would have interpreted the matter complained of in the sense of the words in each\nimputation following the expression \"in that\"\n, they would also accept that the matter complained of conveyed the imputation that the plaintiff \"caused\" the rape and murder\nof Anita Cobby by Lesley Murphy and/or the murder of two men by Andrew Tregurtha. Such a method of pleading was accepted by this Court in Drummoyne Municipal\nCouncil v ABC, provided that it is successful in making clear the meaning for which the plaintiff contends.[12]\nIt was made apparent to counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing of the appeal in the present case that this form of pleading had not been successful in identifying the\nsense in which the word \"caused\" was used in these two imputations.\n\"Caused\" is what has become known as a \"weasel\" word,[13] in that, such is its convenient\nambiguity, no-one will ever know the way in which it is being used or understood. Here, it could mean the immediate cause (or the last link in the chain of causation) or it\ncould mean some preceding link without which the consequences asserted by the plaintiff could not have occurred.[14] Such ambiguity would necessarily be destructive of\na trial involving such emotive issues as this one will involve.\nFollowing the debate as to the form of these two imputations during the hearing of the appeal, the plaintiff was granted leave to substitute the words \"bore a responsibility\nfor\" for the word \"caused\" where it first appears in each imputation and to substitute the words \"which acts in combination caused\" for the words \"which acts caused\"\n,\nwhere they appear in each imputation, so that the imputations in question now read:\n\"(g) The plaintiff bore a responsibility for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby by Lesley Murphy in that he was one of a number of men who had anal intercourse with Murphy\nwhen he was under thirteen years of age which acts in combination caused Murphy such grave psychiatric damage that he raped and murdered Ms Cobby.\n(h) The plaintiff bore a responsibility for the murders of two men by Andrew Tregurtha in that he was one of a number of men who subjected Tregurtha to inhuman and\ndegrading acts of physical sexual abuse when he was a child which acts in combination caused Tregurtha such grave psychiatric damage that he committed the two\nmurders.\n\"\nThe effect of the amendments\nBefore turning to the issue of the capacity of the matter complained of to convey those two imputations, it is important to point out that, like all amendments made during\nthe course of argument, these amendments could well be improved upon further reflection, and to emphasise the very considerable difference made by them to the\npossible gravity of the plaintiff's original complaint. So far as imputation (g) is concerned, the plaintiff is now content with an imputation which asserts no more than that it\nwas the collective effect of all the acts of anal intercourse which Les Murphy had with different men (including the plaintiff) which caused Murphy's psychiatric damage,\nwhich in turn led to his participation in the rape and murder of Anita Cobby.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a139754-0afe-495e-a447-2ad8f84f3cb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a139754-0afe-495e-a447-2ad8f84f3cb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "384de575-b185-4cd9-b9a5-f7339dbc561b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a246cfe5c5940759ca6f0e1bfc25ca66c65b0f892a8d9f600aa3012a7c5629b7"}, "3": {"node_id": "71500d4a-f42b-4276-8f76-6823633ee299", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6be900c7dbe0c366d1b8afcd6e8ea246200e856ec3d1c218b5c5ddf5b82661ba"}}, "hash": "2b74d528d7ec3c574a843ef3a54377a0b28f9dba1932355fea42d6b6fca59f71", "text": "So far as imputation (h) is concerned, the plaintiff is similarly now content with an imputation\nwhich asserts no more than that it was the collective effect of all the inhuman and degrading acts of physical abuse inflicted upon Tregurtha by different men (including the\nplaintiff) which caused Tregurtha's psychiatric damage, which in turn led to his participation in the murder of two men. In each case, the responsibility which the plaintiff\nbore was of a somewhat remote and relatively minor kind, particularly by comparison with a possible interpretation of the imputations as originally pleaded.\nThe law\nThe nature of the submissions made as to the capacity of the matter complained of to convey these two imputations, and as to the issues raised, requires a statement first\nof some matters of general principle.\nThe Privy Council, sitting on appeal from this Court, has held variously that the issue of the capacity of the matter complained of in a defamation action is both a question of\nlaw[15] and a question which is not strictly speaking one of law.[16] In both cases, however, their Lordships have described the task itself as one of deciding whether it is or\nwas open to the jury in the particular case to find that ordinary reasonable readers (or listeners or viewers) would have understood the matter complained of in the\ndefamatory sense pleaded. That is also the issue posed by s 7A(1) of the Defamation Act 1974, which is merely declaratory of the common law. In other words, the issue is\nthe familiar one - one which is often made the subject of a ruling by the trial judge - as to whether there is or was a case to go to the jury.[17]\nThe issue on an appeal from such a ruling is not - as was argued by the plaintiff in the present case - that, as the trial judge had made a finding of fact, the defendant had to\ndemonstrate that he had misdirected himself on a question of law. Even if it were a finding of fact (which it was not), an appeal to this Court is by way of rehearing, the trial\njudge enjoyed no advantage in reaching the decision which he did which this Court does not also enjoy in relation to this issue, and it would be this Court's duty to\ndetermine this issue for itself.[18] The issue in this appeal - as with any other question as to whether there is or was a case to go to the jury - is whether this Court\nindependently comes to the same conclusion in relation to that ruling.\nAlthough \"designed to illuminate a different area\" (namely, negligence), the function of both the trial judge and of this Court on appeal in determining whether there is or was\na case to go to the jury is well stated in Prosser's \"Handbook of the Law of Torts\":19\n\"The most common statement is that if reasonable persons may differ as to the conclusion to be drawn, the issue must be left to the jury; otherwise it is for the court.\n\"\nThat statement has been applied by this Court in negligence actions,[20] and in a defamation action.[21] It was also applied by me in relation to the capacity to defame\nissue, in Farquhar v Bottom[22] in a passage which has been accepted as far afield as Canada.[23]\nThe ordinary reasonable meaning of the matter complained of may be either the literal meaning of the published matter, or what is implied by that matter, or what is inferred\nfrom it.[24] In deciding whether any particular imputation is capable of being conveyed, the question is whether it is reasonably so capable,[25] and any strained or forced or\nutterly unreasonable interpretation must be rejected.[26] The ordinary reasonable reader (or listener or viewer) is a person of fair average intelligence,[27] who is neither\nperverse,[28] nor morbid or suspicious of mind,[29] nor avid for scandal.[30] That person does not live in an ivory tower but can and does read between the lines in the light\nof that person's general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs.[31]\nThe mode or manner of publication is a material matter in determining what imputation is capable of being conveyed.[32] The reader of a book, for example, is assumed to\nread it with more care than he or she would read a newspaper. The more sensational the article in a newspaper, the less likely is it that the ordinary reasonable reader will\nhave read it with the degree of analytical care which may otherwise have been given to a book,[33] and the less the degree of accuracy which would be expected by the\nreader.[34] The ordinary reasonable reader of such an article is understandably prone to engage in a certain amount of loose thinking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71500d4a-f42b-4276-8f76-6823633ee299": {"__data__": {"id_": "71500d4a-f42b-4276-8f76-6823633ee299", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a139754-0afe-495e-a447-2ad8f84f3cb9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b74d528d7ec3c574a843ef3a54377a0b28f9dba1932355fea42d6b6fca59f71"}, "3": {"node_id": "5771fe94-3042-4027-acd5-e6471dcdba8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3dc52b3752d6b9de88a519e5142b9b58d88b2766be89dd4dd92688d7aec8680"}}, "hash": "6be900c7dbe0c366d1b8afcd6e8ea246200e856ec3d1c218b5c5ddf5b82661ba", "text": "[35] There is a wide degree of latitude\ngiven to the capacity of the matter complained of to convey particular imputations where the words published are imprecise, ambiguous, loose, fanciful or unusual.[36]\nAll of these considerations, and more, apply to matter published in a transient form - and particularly in the electronic media. Whereas the reader of the written document\nhas the opportunity to consider or to re-read the whole document at leisure, to check back on something which has gone before to see whether his or her recollection of it\nis correct, and in doing so to change the first impression of what message was being conveyed, the ordinary reasonable listener or viewer has no such opportunity.[37]\nAlthough such a listener or viewer (like the reader of the written article) must be assumed to have heard and/or seen the whole of the relevant programme, he or she may\nnot have devoted the same degree of concentration (particularly, I would say, where it is the radio) to each part of the programme as would otherwise have been given to\nthe written article,[38] and may have missed the significance of the existence, earlier in the programme, of a qualification of a statement made later in the published\nmaterial.[39]\nThe trial judge in a transient publication case will therefore more readily leave it to the jury to decide whether an imputation affected by any of those circumstances, or any\nsimilar circumstances peculiar to such type of publication, was in fact conveyed than he or she would in relation to a written document case.[40] I should add that, in\ndistinguishing between the written and the electronic media, and in referring to the transient form of the latter, I have been referring to what is the fact: that publications\nwhen broadcast or telecast by the electronic media are necessarily transient or ephemeral in nature, notwithstanding provisions such as s 124 of the Broadcasting Act 1942\n(Cwth) and its successor, s 206 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cwth), which deem them to be \"publication in a permanent form\"\n. Such statutory provisions enact a\nfictional situation solely in order to make defamatory statements so published libel rather than slander (and thus avoid the need for proof of special damage).[41] There is no\nlonger any distinction in New South Wales between libel and slander.[42] In any event, such statutory provisions can have no effect upon the circumstances in which the\nlistener or viewer understands what imputations are being conveyed.\nWhat must be emphasised is that it is the test of reasonableness which guides any court in its function of determining whether the matter complained of is capable of\nconveying any of the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff. In determining what is reasonable in any case, a distinction must be drawn between what the ordinary reasonable\nreader, listener or viewer (drawing on his or her own knowledge and experience of human affairs) could understand from what the defendant has said in the matter\ncomplained of and the conclusion which the reader, listener or viewer could reach by taking into account his or her own belief which has been excited by what was said. It\nis the former approach, not the latter, which must be taken.[43] The publisher is not held responsible, for example, for an inference which the ordinary reasonable reader,\nlistener or viewer draws from an inference already drawn from the matter complained of, because it is unreasonable for the publisher to be held so responsible.[44] That is\nan issue which has assumed some importance in this case.\nIt is necessary to emphasise the important distinction between an implication and an inference. An implication is included in and is part of that which is expressed by the\npublisher. It is something which the reader (or listener or viewer) understands the publisher as having intended to say. An inference is something which the reader (or listener\nor viewer) adds to what is stated by the publisher; it may reasonably or even irresistibly follow from what has been expressly or impliedly said, but it is nevertheless a\nconclusion drawn by the reader (or listener or viewer) from what has been expressly or impliedly said by the publisher.[45] It is the reader's (or listener's or viewer's) own\nconclusion. Attention to this distinction, in the context of the capacity to defame issue, seems to have been drawn for the first time in my judgment in Bargold Pty Ltd v\nMirror Newspapers Ltd,\n46 when I pointed out that such a distinction appeared to have been accepted by Lord Devlin in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd.\n47 That distinction\nwas subsequently accepted in that context by this Court in Harrison v Mirror Newspapers Ltd.\n48 The High Court found it unnecessary to discuss the distinction in the\nappeal to that Court in Harrison,\n49 and the distinction therefore stands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5771fe94-3042-4027-acd5-e6471dcdba8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5771fe94-3042-4027-acd5-e6471dcdba8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "71500d4a-f42b-4276-8f76-6823633ee299", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6be900c7dbe0c366d1b8afcd6e8ea246200e856ec3d1c218b5c5ddf5b82661ba"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2d5935c-5460-428d-9853-7000f5ff6a82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "22e08088d2de79b72e951457817557cca439532456d53debc366d47e2e59795d"}}, "hash": "c3dc52b3752d6b9de88a519e5142b9b58d88b2766be89dd4dd92688d7aec8680", "text": "An inference is drawn from an inference when the reader, listener or viewer draws an inference which is available in the matter complained of and then uses that inference\nas a basis (at least in part) from which a further inference is drawn. The publisher is held responsible for the first of those inferences but not for the second because - as I\nhave already said - it is unreasonable for the publisher to be held so responsible. In Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison,\n50 the High Court illustrated the process which\nleads to an inference upon an inference in the case where the matter complained of states that the plaintiff had been charged with an offence. The first inference available\nfrom that statement (for which the publisher is held responsible) is that the police believed the plaintiff to be guilty or had a ground for charging him.[51] The second\ninference, which is based at least in part upon that first inference (and thus is not one for which the publisher is held responsible because it is unreasonable to do so), is that\nthe plaintiff is in fact guilty of the offence charged.[52] That requirement of reasonableness must apply in every case. There can, however, be no unreasonableness involved\nin making the publisher responsible for an inference drawn by the reader (or listener or viewer) from a statement which the publisher is reasonably understood to have\nintended to imply in the matter complained of.\nThe issues\nFor convenience, I repeat the two imputations in issue:\n\"(g) The plaintiff bore a responsibility for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby by Lesley Murphy in that he was one of a number of men who had anal intercourse with Murphy\nwhen he was under thirteen years of age which acts in combination caused Murphy such grave psychiatric damage that he raped and murdered Ms Cobby.\n(h) The plaintiff bore a responsibility for the murders of two men by Andrew Tregurtha in that he was one of a number of men who subjected Tregurtha to inhuman and\ndegrading acts of physical sexual abuse when he was a child which acts in combination caused Tregurtha such grave psychiatric damage that he committed the two\nmurders.\n\"\nAs to imputation (g), Lesley Murphy is referred to by that name expressly in the matter complained of (line 474), and elsewhere as Les Murphy.[53] The matter complained of\nalso expressly asserts that Murphy had been subjected to anal intercourse at the hands of a number of men when he was under thirteen years of age (lines 359-366, 439-\n443, 481-488), and that he raped and murdered Anita Cobby (lines 355-357). There is, however, no express statement that the combination of those acts of anal intercourse\ncaused Murphy such grave psychiatric damage that he committed those crimes. The defendant asserts that the matter complained of is incapable of being reasonably\nunderstood to have implied such statements, but (as I understand it) it does not dispute that a reasonable inference is available to that effect. I will return to the significance\nof that assertion presently.\nAgain, there is no express statement in the matter complained of that the plaintiff ever had anal intercourse with Lesley Murphy when he (Murphy) was under thirteen years\nof age or at all. Nor could any such statement reasonably be understood to have been implied by the matter complained of. That is (as I understand it) conceded by the\nplaintiff. The plaintiff asserts that it was nevertheless a reasonable inference for the ordinary reasonable viewer to have drawn from the matter complained of. The defendant\nasserts that the matter complained of is incapable of giving rise to any reasonable inference to that effect. Whether that inference is capable of reasonably arising is the first\nissue which must now be resolved.\nIf such an inference was available, the defendant says, the imputation as to the plaintiff's responsibility for the asserted consequences of those acts could therefore only be\navailable as an inference upon an inference, and thus it is unreasonable for the publisher to be made responsible for it. The plaintiff asserts that such asserted\nconsequences upon Murphy were reasonably understood to have been implied by the matter complained of. Whether they may reasonably have been understood to have\nbeen implied is the second issue which must be resolved. Whether an inference upon an inference is otherwise permissible in this case is the third such issue.\nFinally in relation to imputation (g), the defendant challenges the assumption made by the imputation that, even if the ordinary reasonable viewer did draw the inference that\nthe plaintiff had had anal intercourse with Les Murphy, he bore any responsibility for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby. That is the fourth issue which must be resolved.\nAs to imputation (h), Andrew Tregurtha is referred to by that name expressly (line 503).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2d5935c-5460-428d-9853-7000f5ff6a82": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2d5935c-5460-428d-9853-7000f5ff6a82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "5771fe94-3042-4027-acd5-e6471dcdba8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3dc52b3752d6b9de88a519e5142b9b58d88b2766be89dd4dd92688d7aec8680"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea9d7a97-02e5-4f1c-805b-265ae3497f6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30051f8b5045c05b440f4c2bced2f394a80262d604ea364c56c411eeef6572d3"}}, "hash": "22e08088d2de79b72e951457817557cca439532456d53debc366d47e2e59795d", "text": "The matter complained of also expressly asserts that he murdered two men (lines\n520-523).

Whether an inference upon an inference is otherwise permissible in this case is the seventh such issue.\nThe first issue: whether the inference that the plaintiff had anal intercourse with Murphy is available\nThe plaintiff submits that an inference that he had anal intercourse with Les Murphy when he was under thirteen years of age may reasonably be drawn from the following\nstatements expressed in or implied by the matter complained of:\n(1) Les Murphy was subjected to anal intercourse at Costello's from the age of eleven or twelve (lines 359-366).\n(2) Costello's was one of the three main centres of paedophile activity in Kings Cross, the most notorious of all (lines 77-80), a paedophile hangout (line 222) and a grim\npaedophile school (lines 501-502), where paedophiles could prey on the young without being interfered with themselves (lines 276-277), where not uncommonly boys had\nsomething slipped into their drink and were taken upstairs or wherever (lines 282-285), and where there were boys as young as nine years old available for sexual purposes\n(lines 300-307) as well as boys aged eleven to thirteen years (lines 295-296).\n(3) Les Murphy first went to Costello's when he was eleven or twelve years old and he was buggered there (lines 363-366). He was especially prized because of his extreme\nyouth (lines 360-362).\n(4) The plaintiff is a paedophile (line 110) who frequently picked up young under age male prostitutes with whom he had sex (lines 122-134, 155-158, 184-190, 199-202, 211-\n214), and he did so at Costello's where he was a patron who liked boys (lines 218-245, 257-259), where he was known to the boys by name and by nickname (\"Madge\")\n(lines 224-226), and where he took a boy upstairs and on other occasions drove boys away in a car (lines 235-239). The age of the boys at Costello's could be seen merely\nby looking at them (lines 296-297).\n(5) Johnny McLean is identified as having had anal intercourse with Les Murphy when he was either eleven or twelve years old or \"pretty young\" (lines 258-268, 368-370,\n411-412, 434-438). Les Murphy's brother Patrick also names three men who have done so - Joe Westwood (lines 439-443, 468-473), Tony Bevan, and a man whose name\nhas been \"beeped out\" (line 481). In its context, the viewer could reasonably have interpreted this as having occurred at Costello's.\nThe basis upon which the plaintiff's case is principally put is that the ordinary reasonable viewer would have identified him as the man named by Patrick Murphy and whose\nname had obviously been deleted by the defendant. Patrick Murphy appears in the second part of the investigation report.

Les Murphy is said by the narrator of the report (Graham Davis) to\nbe serving a life sentence for Anita Cobby's rape and murder.\nWhat happened at Costello's is described in some detail, and it is unnecessary to repeat what I have already said. The narrator goes on to say that Les Murphy (especially\nprized because of his extreme youth) and his brothers Gary and Michael (who were also convicted of that murder), had all been abused at Costello's. Various people\ndescribe how Les Murphy was treated, and detail is given of anal intercourse with Les Murphy by two men: Johnny McLean and Joe (\"Josey no toes\") Westwood. There is\nalso a reference to another man, Tony Bevan (the former mayor of Wollongong), cruising the NSW South Coast looking for children with whom he could have \"sex\"\n. Both\nBevan and McLean are said now to be dead, but Westwood was still alive and living in outback Queensland. Patrick Murphy's statement is then both shown and read out.\nHe says (lines 481-485):\n\"I know for a fact that Tony Bevan, [beep] and Joe Westwood have been molesting children from the age of when I was twelve. My brothers were involved in this and I think\nthat Les, he started off when he was pretty young.\n\"\nPatrick Murphy gives \"sodomising\" as the meaning of \"molesting\" (line 489) - in other words, anal intercourse. His words as read out are interrupted by an audible beep. At\nthe time when they are being read out, the words also appear in printed form on the screen, and the name beeped out is represented by dots.[54]\nThe plaintiff argues that the obvious deletion of the second man's name constituted an invitation by the defendant to the ordinary reasonable viewer to speculate as to the\nidentity of the man named by Patrick Murphy, and to conclude that he had in fact referred to the plaintiff but that the defendant had not dared to republish such an express\nallegation against him.\nThis argument has its origin in the decision of the Privy Council in Jones v Skelton,\n55 in which Jones (a local shire councillor) complained that a letter published in a local\nnewspaper had imputed impropriety on his part as a councillor. The letter attacked the Council's decision to approve the plaintiff's application to convert his garage into\nservants' quarters in the face of its campaign against homeless people living in garages. This almost complete non sequitur was followed by this statement:\n\"It is beyond understanding. Or is it?\"\nThe letter was then signed \"Ratepayer\"\n. The Privy Council said:[56]\n\"The question mark might convey to the reasonable reader the thought and the meaning that there had been some impropriety. The reader, a jury might conclude, was\ninvited to adopt a suspicious approach and so to be guided to the real explanation of what had taken place - an explanation which the writer of the letter did not care or did\nnot dare to express in direct terms. It was therefore open to a jury to decide that a reasonable reader would conclude that the plaintiff had brought improper influence (short\nof corruption) to bear upon his fellow councillors.\n\"\nThe second sentence of that passage was quoted by the Privy Council in its subsequent decision in Lloyd v David Syme & Co Ltd,\n57 as authority for its conclusion that\ncertain phrases in the matter complained of in that case - upon which the defendant had relied as a disclaimer of the imputations otherwise available - did no more than\n\"rather convey the impression that the author is anxious to wound but fearful to strike too obviously\"\n. The allusion, which is an apt one, is to Alexander Pope's \"Epistle to Dr\nArbuthnot\":\n\"Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\nAnd, without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;\nWilling to wound, and yet afraid to strike,\nJust hint a fault, and hesitate dislike.\n\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76c07563-0d3f-4a6b-b7aa-03a10fc6cebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "76c07563-0d3f-4a6b-b7aa-03a10fc6cebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea9d7a97-02e5-4f1c-805b-265ae3497f6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30051f8b5045c05b440f4c2bced2f394a80262d604ea364c56c411eeef6572d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9450513-19bf-44c6-8312-b39de12aae4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dafe4aa8c3d61ceba76078f9546ddb21462755ebc3608b9ff1b3320e4af6b12c"}}, "hash": "6d4f566fa46dfc64f2d8cb8de16379fb1fb6ffc8cd031772c72678984a4148d8", "text": "I accept that the obvious deletion of the name of one of the three men identified by Patrick Murphy as having had anal intercourse with the Murphy brothers at the relevant\ntime - without explanation or qualification - could reasonably have been interpreted by the ordinary reasonable viewer as indicating that the defendant had not dared to\nrepublish such an express allegation against the particular man identified by Patrick Murphy. I also accept that the viewer's natural reaction would have been to speculate\njust who that man was or - to use the more precise language of the Privy Council - to \"adopt a suspicious approach\" in concluding just who that man was. That does not\nnecessarily mean, however, that the defendant is responsible for every conclusion reached in that way.\nWhat the Privy Council was saying in Jones v Skelton is that, if the publisher invites the adoption of a suspicious approach, it is reasonable for him to be responsible for at\nleast some conclusions reached for which it would not otherwise have been reasonable to make him responsible. A degree of conjecture or guesswork is therefore\npermitted which would not otherwise be permitted. However, the requirement of reasonableness still applies. The publisher is not responsible for every conclusion which\nmay have been reached by such conjecture or guesswork.\nI do not accept that the mere beeping out of the man's name could reasonably have been interpreted by the viewer as an invitation by the defendant to guess or speculate\nas widely as the viewer may have liked, in such a way as to make the defendant responsible for whatever conclusion may have been reached by that guesswork. This case\nis quite different from the invitation (\"Or is it?\") in Jones v Skelton. It is as if the face of someone being led into court by police officers had been pixilated (or distorted)\nsimply in order to avoid identification. Much more indication is required before it would be reasonable to interpret what was published as such an invitation. The defendant\nwould nevertheless be responsible for any reasonable inference based in part upon the fact that the defendant had not dared to republish the express allegation against\nthat man, and (by analogy to what Holroyd Pearce LJ said in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd[58]) the defendant could hardly complain if the ordinary reasonable viewer\nreasonably concluded that Patrick Murphy had named someone other than the person whom he had in fact named.\nThe parties put forward various arguments as to whether it was reasonably open to the viewer in the circumstances of this case to conclude that Patrick Murphy had\nidentified the plaintiff by name as one of the three men who had sodomised the Murphy brothers at the relevant time, and in particular that he too had had anal intercourse\nwith Les Murphy at that time.\nThe plaintiff expressly disclaims any reliance upon this being a class libel. Such a concession was undoubtedly correct, as a class libel would be available only if, as the first\nstage, the matter complained of could fairly be read as asserting that each member of the class - that is, every patron of Costello's at the relevant time - had had anal\nintercourse with Les Murphy.[59] The matter complained of here clearly cannot be so interpreted.\nWhat the plaintiff submits is that he is nevertheless pointed to, he is the principal target of the investigation, and that it was therefore reasonable for the viewer to conclude\nthat he was the man named by Patrick Murphy. He points out that he is named at the outset of the report as the man who had attempted to prevent the investigation from\nbeing screened (lines 9-12), and as the man prominent in public life whose behaviour as a paedophile is to be examined in it (lines 104-110). The \"story\" is said to have been\nof such a nature as to be likely to cause many in public life \"to rethink their support for Marsden\" (lines 167-168). After the commercial break, the implications of the\ncontinuing investigation into under age sex in Sydney shows that \"abuse by Sydney men\" had \"created\" people capable of murder (lines 269-273), the Sydney men being\nthe paedophiles who \"preyed on the young\" at Costello's (lines 274-277). The plaintiff is identified, in the way already indicated, as a paedophile who picked up young\nunder age males at Costello's. The narrator says that, for the first time, the defendant had been able to reveal the role which McLean \"and other paedophiles\" played in\n\"spawning some of Australia's most wicked men\" (lines 352-354). Later, the narrator says that the Murphy brothers had been drawn into a ring and that, when McLean had\nfinished with a boy, he would \"simply pass him on to someone else [in the ring]\" (lines 435-438).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9450513-19bf-44c6-8312-b39de12aae4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9450513-19bf-44c6-8312-b39de12aae4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "76c07563-0d3f-4a6b-b7aa-03a10fc6cebf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d4f566fa46dfc64f2d8cb8de16379fb1fb6ffc8cd031772c72678984a4148d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5d09e55-1ba8-4f59-a142-dad29479b4ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b7e5019b2af316fcbdac344e6dac5f0d03305599ad7a8383aa047ed435a82504"}}, "hash": "dafe4aa8c3d61ceba76078f9546ddb21462755ebc3608b9ff1b3320e4af6b12c", "text": "Les Murphy is said to have been buggered at Costello's from when he was\naged eleven or twelve years (lines 363-366). The plaintiff says that he could reasonably have been identified as part of McLean's ring around which Les Murphy was passed,\nbecause he had earlier been described as a member of a \"circle\" of men having \"sex\" with under age boys (lines 199-210), and - because he is also described by reference\nto a number of public offices which he has held (lines 106-109) - he is tied in with McLean and Bevan, who are said to have had a veneer of respectability (lines 336-337).\nMcLean is directly linked with Bevan as a friend (lines 313-325).\nThe plaintiff also submits that the ordinary reasonable viewer would interpret the defendant's fear of republishing the express allegation made by Patrick Murphy against the\nthird man as arising from the fact that the third man was still alive. He points out that, of all the men named or tied in as part of McLean's ring of paedophiles who had had\nanal intercourse with Les Murphy, only he and Westwood are said to be still alive, and Westwood is already named by Patrick Murphy. He must therefore be the man who\nwas named. However, this line of reasoning seems to me necessarily to involve the process of drawing an inference (that Patrick Murphy had named the plaintiff) based at\nleast in part upon another inference (that the reason why the defendant dared not republish that express allegation by Murphy was because he was still alive and could sue).\nAlternatively, the plaintiff also submits that, such is the nature of the allegations of anal intercourse with Les Murphy already made expressly in the matter complained of\nagainst McLean, the ordinary reasonable viewer would have discarded McLean as being the person against whom the defendant had not dared to republish the express\nallegation of such intercourse made by Patrick Murphy. That left the plaintiff as the only man named or tied in as part of McLean's ring of paedophiles who had had such\nintercourse with Les Murphy. In my view, such a line of reasoning does not involve a process of drawing an inference upon an inference.\nIf all these matters are taken in isolation, it would in my opinion be open to the jury to find that the ordinary reasonable viewer would have identified the plaintiff as the man\nnamed by Patrick Murphy as having had anal intercourse with his brother Les at the relevant time, but whose name had been deleted by the defendant. I am not satisfied,\nhowever, that such a finding would be open on any basis which did not depend upon such an interpretation of what Patrick Murphy said. Such is the seriousness of the\nallegation that any other basis for such an inference would require such an extent of sheer speculation that it would be quite unreasonable to make the defendant\nresponsible for it.[60] Any such basis would have been available only if the matter complained of had constituted a class libel but, as it cannot be interpreted as asserting\nthat every patron of Costello's had had anal intercourse with Les Murphy at the relevant time, there is (as the plaintiff correctly conceded) no class libel here. The alternative\nbasis upon which the plaintiff puts his case - which does not depend upon Patrick Murphy's naming of him - necessarily fails.\nBut those matters must be looked at not in isolation but in the context of the whole of the matter complained of. Upon this basis, the defendant submits that it would have\nbeen unreasonable for the ordinary reasonable viewer to have drawn such an inference for at least two reasons.\nPrimarily, the defendant says that it must have been obvious to the viewer that the investigation fell into two quite distinct and self-contained segments: the first dealing with\nthe plaintiff's paedophile activity and with his false denials of it; and the second dealing with the consequences of paedophilia generally upon the boys themselves. The only\nnexus between the two parts, the defendant says, is the subject of paedophilia. The defendant conceded that, at the very end of the first part, the narrator introduces\nMcLean as the pervert whose awful legacy is to be seen in the second part of the investigation report, but it says that this was for the obvious purpose of informing the\nviewers of what was to follow, and to keep them tuned in after the commercial break. The defendant points out that the plaintiff is neither named nor pictured in the second\npart of the report,[61] and it argues that the ordinary reasonable viewer must have understood that there had been no intention on its part in the second part of the report to\nrefer back to anything to do with the plaintiff.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5d09e55-1ba8-4f59-a142-dad29479b4ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5d09e55-1ba8-4f59-a142-dad29479b4ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9450513-19bf-44c6-8312-b39de12aae4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dafe4aa8c3d61ceba76078f9546ddb21462755ebc3608b9ff1b3320e4af6b12c"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1a412a3-721e-4470-a822-caae3fdc865b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91a4b15b2bb653bd55a77476e43b041e9160a9cd2b7c87dc282dde1e723d5379"}}, "hash": "b7e5019b2af316fcbdac344e6dac5f0d03305599ad7a8383aa047ed435a82504", "text": "The defendant, of course, does have to persuade this Court that the viewer must have so interpreted the matter complained of\nin order to defeat the plaintiff's argument. If the interpretation for which the plaintiff contends is reasonably open, then it is a jury question as to whether the ordinary\nreasonable viewer would in fact have so interpreted the matter complained of.\nThere are, however, a number of statements made during the investigation report - some of them admittedly ambiguous - which tend to contradict the interpretation for\nwhich the defendant contends as that which the ordinary reasonable viewer must have given to the matter complained of. The fact that some of those statements are\nambiguous operates in the plaintiff's favour upon this issue.\nThe plaintiff is said at the outset to have failed to stop the screening of an investigation into under age sex in Sydney (lines 1-3, 9-12) - a single investigation which has more\nthan one part (line 16) - and no attempt is made at that early stage to indicate that the different parts of that investigation which the plaintiff failed to stop being screened\nwere intended to be quite distinct and self-contained. Early in the first part, and in a passage already quoted earlier in this judgment, the narrator says (while a photograph\nof the plaintiff is being shown on the screen) that the \"story\"\n- a single story, not the first of two stories - will not only fuel the public outrage about paedophile activity, it will\nalso send shock waves through \"the Establishment\" because of the behaviour of the plaintiff - a man with friends in the highest places - is to be examined (lines 102-110).\nAgain, no attempt is made at that stage to indicate that it is only in the first part of the investigation report that the plaintiff's behaviour will be examined. Then, when\nMcLean is introduced at the conclusion of the first part as the pervert whose awful legacy is to be seen in the second part of the report (lines 258-268), again there is no\nattempt to indicate that the examination of the plaintiff's behaviour was now completed.\nAt the very conclusion of \"The Dark Side\"\n, the narrator says (lines 549-552):\n\"And for the abused, corrupted bodies make for corrupted values. It's all part of an appalling legacy - the betrayal of trust, the shattered dreams, the lives wasted by drugs\nand self loathing.\n\"\nThe youth worker says (lines 553-558):\n\"The price of our neglect of these kids has been very high in actual fact. That we have ignored their pleas, we, we, we've neglected them in this way as a community, we've\npaid a very high price for that.\nQ. Because they bounced back and smacked us around? A. They sure did.\n\"\nAnd the boy who appears in both parts of the investigation report says (lines 559-562):\n\"It's a dark part of society that they don't look at. It's got to be addressed, it's got to be cleaned up because [if] you don't, society doesn't need more people like me and\nothers walking around.\"\nThe defendant argues that the reference here by the narrator to the appalling legacy, echoing the introduction to the second part of the report and the subject matter of that\nsecond part (the awful legacy of McLean the pervert), makes it clear that this was intended to summarise only the second part of the report. However, the narrator's final\nstatement is at least also open to the reasonable interpretation that it was intended to be a summary of the whole report, which commenced with the presenter, having\nreferred to the plaintiff's unsuccessful attempt to prevent the investigation into under age sex in Sydney being screened, saying (lines 12-16):\n\"In recent months Australians have been shocked with revelations of men who have sexually abused children. Tonight some of those victims strike back, they give us the\nnames of the men who've abused them.\n\"\nOnly after that statement has been made is it indicated that the investigation report is to have more than one part. The link here is between the \"sexually abused children\"\nreferred to at the commencement and the \"abused\"\n- that is, the sexually abused children - to whom the narrator refers at the conclusion. The defendant also argues that\nthe appearance of the boy in both parts of the report is clearly explicable, and thus of neutral effect upon this issue.

The defendant says that, such is the\nnature of the allegations made against the plaintiff expressly and by clear implication in the first part of the report, the ordinary reasonable viewer must have discarded the\nplaintiff as being the person against whom the defendant had not dared to republish the express allegation of anal intercourse with Les Murphy made by Patrick Murphy.\nThe defendant says that everything which could have been said against the plaintiff had been said against him in the first part of the report, which the defendant describes\nas being confrontationalist and \"no holds barred\" in nature, with nothing left to the imagination.\nThere are, however, two matters of some significance involved in such an allegation that the plaintiff had had anal intercourse with Les Murphy which were not alleged\nagainst him in the first part. First, there is what the plaintiff says is the responsibility which anyone who had had such intercourse with Les Murphy bears for his subsequent\nviolence, whatever the extent of that responsibility may be. (I leave for later the defendant's challenge to the assumption made by imputation (g) that any such consequence\nfollows; at this stage, I am concerned only with the issue as to whether the matter complained of is capable of conveying the inference that the plaintiff did have anal\nintercourse with Murphy.) Secondly, there is what could reasonably be interpreted as a significant difference in substance between having anal intercourse with boys aged\nfourteen or fifteen years and already prostituting themselves, as alleged against the plaintiff in the first half of the report (lines 65-66, 149-158, 191-193, 247-249), and having\nanal intercourse with a boy only eleven or twelve years old, which is the age at which Les Murphy is said to have first been buggered and corrupted (lines 363-366).\nIndeed, the defendant relies upon the difference is substance between the two allegations as another reason why the ordinary reasonable viewer must have discarded the\nplaintiff as being the third man expressly named by Patrick Murphy. To some extent, this distinction is strengthened by two of the plaintiff's own statements included in the\nprogramme: one to the effect that, like heterosexuals, gay men do not ask young males whom they meet for sex to produce their birth certificates (lines 127-130), and the\nother (lines 165-166):\n\"As far as I know, I have never ever slept with someone under age.\n\"[62]\nThese statements, although challenged in the investigation, could be interpreted as suggesting that the plaintiff's sexual interests lay in relation to boys beyond the age of\npuberty, rather than those who had not yet reached that stage of sexual development.\nAgain, these further arguments - taken singly or in combination with the defendant's primary argument - do not persuade me that it would not have been reasonable for the\nordinary reasonable viewer to have drawn the inference from what was published that Patrick Murphy had named the plaintiff as having sodomised Les Murphy when he\nwas \"pretty young\"\n- that is, having had anal intercourse with him when he was at least under thirteen years of age.\nI am thus satisfied by the plaintiff that an inference that he did have such intercourse with Les Murphy is open on the matter complained of, but only upon that basis - the\nprincipal basis upon which the plaintiff's case has been put. In my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff has succeeded in relation to the first issue to be resolved, on the\nprincipal basis upon which his case has been put.\nThe second issue: whether the psychiatric damage to Murphy from anal intercourse as asserted in the imputation could have been understood to have been\nimplied in the matter complained of\nThe imputation asserts that the collective effect of the acts of anal intercourse with Les Murphy by different men when he was under thirteen years of age was to cause him\nsuch grave psychiatric damage that he raped and murdered Anita Cobby. The plaintiff has argued that such consequences were reasonably understood to have been\nimplied by the matter complained of.

He and other paedophiles played a role in spawning some of\nAustralia's most wicked men, including Les Murphy who raped and murdered Anita Cobby (lines 264-268, 351-358).\n(3) Kids who are the product of this kind of persistent and constant abuse are bred into people who are capable of doing almost anything (lines 494-499).\n(4) The corrupted bodies of those who have been abused lead to corrupted values. It's all part of an appalling legacy: the betrayal of trust, the shattered dreams, and the\nlives wasted by drugs and self-loathing (lines 549-552).\n(5) A very high price has been paid for the neglect of these kids and for ignoring their pleas (lines 549-552).\n(6) One of the boys interviewed, who had originally been abused at the age of fourteen (lines 35-39), also says that he has a lot of anger inside him, and he wonders\nsometimes what he is capable of doing (lines 348-350).\n(7) Les Murphy was a gentle kid when he moved in with McLean at Costello's (line 373), where he was especially prized because of his extreme youth (lines 361-362) and\nwhere he was being buggered (by the patrons of Costello's) when he was aged eleven or twelve years (lines 363-366).\n(8) The Murphys were, however, corrupted with the passing years (lines 382-383). Youth worker Anne Crow says that, when she saw Les Murphy, he was not a very nice kid\n(line 392).\n(9) Anita Cobby was a victim of graduates of the grim paedophile school called \"Costello's\" (lines 500-502).\n(10) How much the abuse affected the development of the Murphy brothers can only be guessed at, though the savagery which they went on to inflict and the pain which\nthey caused the Cobby family is all too well known (lines 489-492).\n(11) The person who murdered Anita Cobby was psychopathic (line 493 in its context).\nOther than the bald denial that the implication for which the plaintiff contends was reasonably available as such, the defendant has offered no argument upon this issue. I\nam satisfied that the implication was so available. Any finding by the jury to the contrary would in my view be almost perverse. In my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff has\nsucceeded in relation to the second issue to be resolved as well.\nThe third issue: whether an inference upon an inference is otherwise permissible in this case\nIn the light of what I have already said when discussing the law applicable to the capacity of the matter complained of to convey a particular imputation, this third issue\narises only because of statements made by Levine J in his judgment under appeal which suggest that a publisher may nevertheless be responsible in some cases for an\ninference which is drawn upon another inference. What the judge said was this:\n\"The principles in relation to inference drawing are apparently entrenched. It is their application that might have to be reconsidered in the light of the development of the\ntechniques of modern media communications. If a process of reasoning is fairly capable of being described as an inference upon an inference leading to an imputation, or a\nprocess of reasoning fairly can be described as \"speculation\" leading to an imputation, the current state of the law would appear to preclude a plaintiff ever relying upon any\nimputation founded upon such a process of reasoning or indeed upon speculation. I am of the view that this should no longer necessarily be the case. In other words the\nidentification of the process of reasoning as inference upon inference, or indeed as speculation, should not automatically and finally preclude a plaintiff relying upon an\nimputation arrived at by such processes. The nature of the processes can always be identified as inference upon inference or as speculation, but the consequences (the\nimputations thereby arrived at) may have to be reconsidered in the light of the published material.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f7c46cb-3e2f-469e-827c-7ae8b7660bfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f7c46cb-3e2f-469e-827c-7ae8b7660bfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "53a95430-48d2-4982-976e-c9c704f45eaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20859a0a854c637525482cc3be17fec826436591819c194562e3ae3f7a059dca"}, "3": {"node_id": "af959697-502a-405c-bc3c-44837832bf1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0f4ebe6a9fc11a3504d4476267464a3eee577a03bf376b5a0a543b1f2179033"}}, "hash": "c0510013d480b41de3204373c3845a4e92d20090cd3d4fb884a9d7d380060894", "text": "Unduly precious and painstaking identification of the ratiocination of the recipient of a publication, and analysis thereof, can lead to an unreasonable and unrealistic and\nthus an unfair and unjust outcome on the question of the capacity of a publication in this era conveying meanings to readers/viewers/ listeners of this era.\nIf the nature of the published material is calculated to, that is likely to have the effect of, or can fairly be described as an invitation to speculate to a given end or to draw an\ninference upon an inference, and those inferences readily can be identified by reason of the nature and quality of the program itself, why should not the publisher be\nresponsible for them?\n`In your face' television, it can be fairly be argued, leaves nothing or extremely little to the imagination or to free thought.

The plaintiff asserts that they did not; the defendant asserts that they did. It may fairly be said that the judge's intention is unclear from\nthe judgment itself. But the plaintiff is still arguing before this Court that the viewer was being invited to speculate, the defendant is still arguing that the imputations could\nonly be conveyed by drawing an inference upon an inference, and there still remains an issue for the jury as to whether the psychiatric damage to Les Murphy from anal\nintercourse at the relevant age was understood to have been implied in the matter complained of rather than inferred from it. If, contrary to what I would expect the jury to\nfind, they are not satisfied that it was so implied, it will be necessary for the trial judge to direct them as to what the consequences of that finding will be. For this reason, it\nis necessary for this Court to consider whether the statements made by Levine J are correct. It was the existence of these statements in his judgment upon which the\ndefendant relied when successfully seeking leave to appeal.\nWhat Levine J says should no longer be the law is that a plaintiff is precluded from relying upon any imputation founded upon either of two processes of reasoning - those\nwhich are \"fairly capable of being described\" either as drawing an inference upon an inference or as speculation. The law at present does indeed preclude a plaintiff from\nreliance upon the first of those processes of reasoning. The judge accepts that that principle is entrenched. It certainly is, by decisions in the House of Lords[64] and the\nHigh Court.[65] A plaintiff is not, however, completely precluded from reliance upon the second of those processes of reasoning. The decision of the Privy Council in Jones\nv Skelton permits a reasonable degree of conjecture or speculation where the publisher has invited it, as I have already pointed out.\nEach of the two processes of reasoning is, of course, quite different from the other, and there is room for misunderstanding when the two are considered together as they\nhave been by the judge in this case. There is also room for misunderstanding when the issue is described, again as it has been by the judge, as whether a process of\nreasoning is one which is merely \"fairly capable of being described\" as drawing an inference upon an inference. (I will not cause further misunderstanding by continuing to\nconsider both processes of reasoning together.) Where the capacity of the matter complained of to convey a particular imputation is being considered, it is true to say that\nthe defendant will fail to exclude it from the jury unless that imputation can only be conveyed by such a process. Except in that situation, however, it will usually be for the\njury to determine whether the first step in the process of reasoning involves an implication or an inference. They must be directed that, if the imputation does arise, and if it\ndoes arise from drawing an inference upon an inference rather than upon an implication, it would not be reasonable for the defendant to be made responsible for that\nimputation, and the defendant is entitled to succeed in relation to it. It would therefore be very unwise to refer to any process of reasoning which is merely \"fairly capable of\nbeing described\" in that way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af959697-502a-405c-bc3c-44837832bf1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "af959697-502a-405c-bc3c-44837832bf1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f7c46cb-3e2f-469e-827c-7ae8b7660bfe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0510013d480b41de3204373c3845a4e92d20090cd3d4fb884a9d7d380060894"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e4fccb8-965c-4606-a4a5-4888e301ad15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1d204f3662db0aac64efe309813c13aed42b4da1c29c337a0433562c85f16cc"}}, "hash": "c0f4ebe6a9fc11a3504d4476267464a3eee577a03bf376b5a0a543b1f2179033", "text": "Levine J, having accepted that the exclusion of an imputation reached by this process of reasoning results from an entrenched principle, suggests that this should no longer\nbe the case and that the plaintiff should not be precluded from relying upon such an imputation reached where -\n\"\n... the nature of the published material is ... likely to have the effect of, or can fairly be described as, an invitation ... to draw an inference upon an inference, and [that\ninference] readily can be identified by reason of the nature and quality of the programme itself.\n\"\nThe judge did not provide an example of a publication which had such characteristics. I am frankly unable to formulate one for myself. I would have thought, with respect,\nthat in almost every case - if, indeed, not in every case - a publication could have such characteristics, including an identification of the ultimate inference to be drawn, only\nbecause either the imputation was implicit in the matter complained of or there was only one inference to be drawn.\nThe judge concluded that the matter complained of here was capable of being understood as inviting the viewer to adopt both processes of reasoning, and he reserved his\nview as to whether it went so far as to compel the viewer to do so. This conclusion appears to have been based upon an interpretation of the matter complained of as\n\"calculated virtually to preclude a viewer, and a reasonable viewer, from the bother of forming any independent judgment\"\n. There is, the judge says,\n\"little, if any, room for\nquestioning the position of the defendant in the story told by [the matter complained of]\"\n. I do not agree. I have already held that the present case does not invite the viewer\nto speculate by merely deleting the name of the man identified by Patrick Murphy. Nor does it either invite or (still less) compel a process of reasoning by drawing an\ninference upon an inference.\nI recognise that the techniques of defamation by modern media communications have developed in a way which Alexander Pope could never have envisaged, and that the\napplication of the principles laid down by the House of Lords and the High Court must keep up with those developments. The advent of radio and television has already\nresulted in trial judges in cases involving such publications more readily leaving it to a jury to decide whether an imputation has been conveyed than they would in relation\nto a written document case. I referred to that principle earlier in this judgment. But, in the end, the test remains one of reasonableness - whether it is reasonable to hold the\npublisher responsible for a conclusion which is not reasonably understood to have been expressed or implied by what the publisher has said, but which the ordinary\nreasonable reader (or listener or viewer) has drawn for himself or herself, perhaps by having taken into account his or own beliefs which have been excited by what was\npublished. As I understand the law of defamation, that is fundamental to the publisher's responsibility. If the publisher does anything which makes it reasonable for him to\nbe held responsible for something more (such as by an invitation to speculate), then he is made responsible for it. That is nothing new, and the principles remain the same.\nThere is nothing in the present case - notwithstanding its \"in your face\" approach - to suggest that those principles should be applied in any different way to the way in\nwhich they are usually applied. With all due respect to Levine J, I am entirely unable to agree with what he has said.\nIn my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff has failed in relation to the third issue to be resolved, but that failure does not prevent imputation (g) going to the jury.\nThe fourth issue: whether the plaintiff bore any responsibility for the rape and murder of Anita Cobby even if he did have anal intercourse with Les Murphy\nThe defendant submits that, as it is expressly stated in the matter complained of that McLean was responsible for having lured Les Murphy into the paedophile \"net\" (lines\n411-412), for having corrupted him (lines 264-265, 434-438) and for having fathered his appalling violence (lines 351-358),[66] and as it is also expressly stated that his\nmurder of Anita Cobby was McLean's legacy (lines 263-268), it would have been unreasonable for the viewer to identify the plaintiff as bearing any responsibility for that\nmurder.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e4fccb8-965c-4606-a4a5-4888e301ad15": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e4fccb8-965c-4606-a4a5-4888e301ad15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "af959697-502a-405c-bc3c-44837832bf1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0f4ebe6a9fc11a3504d4476267464a3eee577a03bf376b5a0a543b1f2179033"}, "3": {"node_id": "53063341-d803-4997-954f-e26921cfb7d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "417ed3e257082ab68d3f589f686cce99a8143603113149423ede37c02e3f81c2"}}, "hash": "d1d204f3662db0aac64efe309813c13aed42b4da1c29c337a0433562c85f16cc", "text": "The defendant has emphasised that it was McLean who created the under age sex industry by providing Costello's, which was the \"school\" from which Les Murphy\nand others had graduated (lines 501-502), that there is no express or implied statement in the matter complained of that the plaintiff knew McLean, and that the plaintiff is\nshown to be no more than a mere consumer - or, as it was put in argument (no doubt by analogy to trade practices law) he is an \"end user\"\n- of the services provided there.\nLes Murphy, it is said, was already corrupted by McLean before he was passed around the ring. He was also subjected to very rough treatment by Westwood whilst living\nwith him (lines 465-470).\nThis argument is to some extent contradicted by the statement of the narrator that the Murphy brothers were \"being corrupted with the passing years\" (lines 382-383) but,\neven if the defendant is accepted as having demonstrated that the ordinary reasonable viewer must have interpreted the programme as asserting that Les Murphy was\noriginally corrupted by McLean, that does not, in my view, necessarily deny that those consumers who merely had anal intercourse with Les Murphy at the relevant time\n(although after he had been originally corrupted by McLean) still bear at least some responsibility for the cumulative effect of their actions.\nThe defendant's argument was first put prior to the plaintiff's amendment of the two imputations in question. In relation to the original imputation (g), the argument had\nsubstantial strength. The effect of the amendments, however, has been - as I said earlier - to assert a responsibility on the part of the plaintiff for the murder of Anita Cobby\nof a somewhat remote and relatively minor kind, on the basis that it was the collective effect of all the acts of anal intercourse which Les Murphy had had with different men\n(including the plaintiff) which caused Murphy's psychiatric damage. The fact that McLean obviously bears the principal responsibility for that psychiatric damage does not,\naccordingly, absolve those others who had anal intercourse with him at the relevant time from any responsibility at all.\nIn my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff has succeeded in relation to the fourth issue to be resolved. Accordingly, in my view, the defendant's appeal in relation to imputation\n(g) should be dismissed, although I stress that the basis upon which I hold that the imputation should go to the jury is very different to that upon which the plaintiff\nsucceeded before Levine J. This is an issue which is relevant to the order which should be made as to costs.\nThe fifth issue: whether the inference that the plaintiff subjected Tregurtha to inhuman and degrading acts is available\nThe plaintiff submits that an inference that he subjected Andrew Tregurtha to inhuman and degrading acts may reasonably have been drawn from the following statements\nexpressed in or implied by the matter complained of:\n(1) Andrew Tregurtha was a male prostitute (line 520) and a graduate of the grim paedophile school called \"Costello's\" (lines 500-503), where he had worked at the bar (lines\n503-504).\n(2) The plaintiff is a paedophile (line 110) who frequently picked up young under age male prostitutes with whom he had sex (lines 122-134, 155-158, 184-190, 199-202, 211-\n214), and he did so at Costello's where he was a patron who liked boys (lines 218-245, 257-259), where he was known to the boys by name and by nickname (\"Madge\")\n(lines 224-226), and where he took a boy upstairs and on other occasions drove boys away in a car (lines 235-239). The age of the boys at Costello's could be seen merely\nby looking at them (lines 296-297).\n(3) The plaintiff had certain fetishes for slapping boys on the backside while having sex with them, because that was what excited him (lines 144-147), to the extent that the\nboys would remember him for the things which he did (lines 180-182). He had treated one boy named Mark badly and very roughly in a room upstairs at Costello's, causing\nthe boy to describe him as a mongrel or an arsehole.\n(4) One boy who identifies the plaintiff as having had sex with him at the age of fifteen (lines 155-158), or maybe fourteen and a half (lines 143-151), says that he had been\nraped and raped, he had begged and cried to be let go, and he had been let go bleeding like a pig (lines 37-39).\nI do not accept that it was open to the viewer reasonably to associate the incident described in the fourth paragraph with the plaintiff.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53063341-d803-4997-954f-e26921cfb7d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "53063341-d803-4997-954f-e26921cfb7d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e4fccb8-965c-4606-a4a5-4888e301ad15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1d204f3662db0aac64efe309813c13aed42b4da1c29c337a0433562c85f16cc"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d5ce367-bee4-41a6-bbaa-bc1f2dea4b62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8edd842ec21a6c344f869f66d741451f932bd0db565ef837e2400425416634fe"}}, "hash": "417ed3e257082ab68d3f589f686cce99a8143603113149423ede37c02e3f81c2", "text": "In its context, it appears that this\nhappened when the boy was fourteen, but it is the same boy who describes the plaintiff's fetish for slapping boys on the backside (lines 144-147), and he makes no mention\nat that stage of any more serious violence on the part of the plaintiff. The matter complained of also asserts that this boy had been introduced into the paedophile scene by\nMcLean (lines 430-435), and that it was McLean who had fathered such anger in him that he wondered what he was capable of doing (lines 346-351). Even allowing for the\nlooser application of the usual tests in the case of transient or ephemeral publications by the electronic media, it would in my view be wholly unreasonable to identify the\nplaintiff as responsible for the violence described in the fourth paragraph.\nThe plaintiff again submits that he is the principal target of the investigation, for the reasons stated when I was dealing with the first issue (as to whether the plaintiff had had\nanal intercourse with Les Murphy), and that he is said to be a paedophile who inflicts violence on boys with whom he has sex. He says that he would thus be identified by\nthe ordinary reasonable viewer as one of the men responsible for subjecting Tregurtha to inhuman and degrading acts. Again, he correctly disclaims any reliance upon a\nclass libel. In my view, the matter complained of cannot be interpreted as asserting that every patron of Costello's had subjected Tregurtha to such acts.\nThere is nothing in the matter complained of which provides a peg or pointer to the plaintiff in relation to Tregurtha to which the common law pleader could have affixed in\nparenthesis the words \"meaning thereby the plaintiff\"\n, as there was in relation to Les Murphy - the man identified by Patrick Murphy and whose name was \"beeped\" out by\nthe defendant. Such a peg or pointer is not necessary,[67] but its absence inevitably makes it more difficult for the plaintiff to establish that, in the absence of a class libel,\nhe could reasonably have been identified by the ordinary reasonable viewer as one of the men who had subjected Tregurtha to such acts.\nThe plaintiff nevertheless seeks to do so by reference to two particular matters. First, he says that the violence alleged against him and detailed in the third paragraph above\ndemonstrates to the viewer that he is no ordinary paedophile, and so is a likely candidate for having subjected Tregurtha to such acts. The degree of violence alleged,\nhowever, is very much less than inhuman, and it is only degrading to a minor extent when considered against the general background alleged - far less than would be\nrequired in the mind of the ordinary reasonable viewer to effect the psychiatric damage required, even in combination with the acts of others. Secondly, the plaintiff says\nthat, if the imputation concerning Les Murphy is capable of arising, the imputation concerning Andrew Tregurtha is more likely also to arise because both are described as\ngraduates of the grim paedophile school called \"Costello's\" (lines 500-503). I acknowledge that link, but it does not persuade me that the viewer could reasonably conclude\nthat, because the plaintiff had had anal intercourse with Les Murphy, he would also have inflicted inhuman and degrading acts on Andrew Tregurtha. I am not satisfied that\nthis inference is reasonably available. As in relation to the alternative basis upon which the plaintiff's case was put in relation to Les Murphy (the first issue resolved), the\nextent of sheer speculation involved in accepting a serious allegation of this type as referring to the plaintiff is such that it would be quite unreasonable to make the\ndefendant responsible for it.\nIn my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff has failed in relation to the fifth issue. Accordingly, in my view, the defendant's appeal in relation to imputation (h) should be upheld.\nAs the two remaining issues were fully debated, however, I propose to record my views in relation to them.\nSixth issue: whether the psychiatric damage to Tregurtha from inhuman and degrading acts could have been understood to have been implied in the matter\ncomplained of\nThe imputation asserts that the collective effect of the inhuman and degrading acts to which Andrew Tregurtha was subjected by different men was to cause him such grave\npsychiatric damage that he committed two murders. The issue as to whether such an assertion was reasonably understood to have been implied by the matter complained\nof is similar to the second issue which has already been resolved in favour of the plaintiff, and it relies upon largely the same material.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d5ce367-bee4-41a6-bbaa-bc1f2dea4b62": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d5ce367-bee4-41a6-bbaa-bc1f2dea4b62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cc82290ee41954df4e4b29748bf5fa27bb2f009733b8912aa6078bd391c23ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "53063341-d803-4997-954f-e26921cfb7d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "417ed3e257082ab68d3f589f686cce99a8143603113149423ede37c02e3f81c2"}, "3": {"node_id": "edc57552-a17f-44a7-9253-cb7a50a49aba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6621040e3a202da3ab881d214924c61301026dce8e9f92fc19da4f2e0338a84"}}, "hash": "8edd842ec21a6c344f869f66d741451f932bd0db565ef837e2400425416634fe", "text": "The plaintiff argues that the implication for which he contends here could reasonably have been so understood by the ordinary reasonable viewer from the following\nstatements made expressly in the matter complained of:\n(1) Abuse of children by Sydney men created people capable of the most horrific crimes, including murder (lines 264-268, 270-273, 524-528, 535-543).\n(2) Abuse by McLean fathered anger in one boy (not Andrew Tregurtha); in others he fathered appalling violence. He and other paedophiles played a role in spawning some\nof Australia's most wicked men, including Les Murphy who raped and murdered Anita Cobby (lines 264-268, 351-358).\n(3) Kids who are the product of this kind of persistent and constant abuse are bred into people who are capable of doing almost anything (lines 494-499).\n(4) The corrupted bodies of those who have been abused lead to corrupted values. It's all part of an appalling legacy: the betrayal of trust, the shattered dreams, and the\nlives wasted by drugs and self-loathing (lines 549-552).\n(5) A very high price has been paid for the neglect of these kids and for ignoring their pleas (lines 549-552).\n(6) One of the boys interviewed, who had originally been abused at the age of fourteen (lines 35-39), also says that he has a lot of anger inside him, and he wonders\nsometimes what he is capable of doing (lines 348-350).\n(7) Andrew Tregurtha had been a really nice kid from a good family, very polite, well mannered, well spoken, articulate and intelligent (lines 501-512, 529-530); but, by the\ntime he murdered the two men, he was a graduate of the grim paedophile school called \"Costello's\" (lines 500-503).\n(8) At the time of the killings, his self-esteem was right down to rock bottom (lines 545-546), and the value on his own life was so low that the thought of taking someone\nelse's life was not as horrifying to him as it may have been to other people (lines 535-540).\nAgain, other than a bald denial that the implication for which the plaintiff contends was reasonably available as such, the defendant has offered no argument upon this\nissue. I am satisfied that the implication was so available and that any finding by the jury to the contrary would be almost perverse. In my judgment, therefore, the plaintiff\nhas succeeded in relation to the sixth issue.\nThe seventh and last issue: whether an inference upon an inference is otherwise permissible in this case\nFor the reasons which I gave in relation to the third issue, in my judgment the plaintiff has failed in relation to this issue also.\nCosts\nEach party has succeeded in the appeal in relation to one imputation but has failed in relation to the other imputation. As to imputation (g), the plaintiff succeeded upon only\none of the two bases argued, a very different basis to that which was successful before Levine J, and then only after he had substantially amended the imputation. On the\nother hand, the defendant failed to object to the form of the imputations when the matter was heard by Levine J.\nIn those circumstances, each party should in my judgment pay his and its own costs both in the proceedings before Levine J (so far as they related to these two\nimputations) and in this Court.\nORDERS PROPOSED\n(1) The defendant's appeal is upheld in part, and the orders made by Levine J in relation to imputations (g) and (h) are set aside.\n(2) Imputation (g) (as amended) will go to the jury.\n(3) Imputation (h) (as amended) will not go to the jury.\n(4) Each party is to pay his and its own costs both in the proceedings before Levine J (so far as they related to imputations (g) and (h)) and in the Court of Appeal.\n[1] In fact, it was the dismissal by a single justice of the High Court of the plaintiff's application for an injunction pending the hearing of his application for special leave to\nappeal from the decisions of Levine J and of this Court refusing an injunction to restrain the defendant from telecasting this investigation: Levine J (29 April 1996,\nunreported); Court of Appeal (2 May 1996, unreported); Gummow J [1996] HCA 13; (1996) 136 ALR 243.\n[2] There are four commercial breaks in the one hour \"Witness\" programme, each of approximately the same length.

He does so, not on\nthe basis that Mr Moloney is in possession of confidential information of the plaintiffs which is at risk of disclosure, but on the basis that, in its supervisory jurisdiction, the\nCourt should prevent Mr Moloney from acting in this particular case, due to the likelihood of his being a material witness and having a perceived interest in the outcome. Mr\nHunt, Dibsenta and Randall, and Mr Moloney, oppose the application.\nDramatis Personae\n2 The second plaintiff Chepan Pty Limited is a company of which Mr Kallinicos is and was at all material times a director; it does not feature in the present application.\n3 Mr Hunt is the only director of Dibsenta. Dibsenta\u2019s shareholders are Mr Hunt and his domestic partner Kay Susanne La Forest as to ten each of the twenty ordinary\nissued shares.\n4 Mr Hunt and Ms La Forest are the sole directors of Randall, and each hold one of the two issued ordinary shares in it.\n5 Mr Kallinicos, his wife Mrs Kallinicos (nee Vatalis), Mr Hunt and Ms La Forest are the directors of P&K, and each of Mr Kallinicos and Mr Hunt hold one of the two ordinary\nissued shares in P&K.\n6 Rowntree's directors are Mr Kallinicos and Mr Hunt, and although its shareholders are recorded as Mr and Mrs Kallinicos, it is conceded by Mr Kallinicos that they should\nbe himself and Mr Hunt, not Mrs Kallinicos.

To understand the circumstances\nwhich are said to raise objection to Mr Moloney acting for the defendants, it is necessary to appreciate some aspects of how Mr Kallinicos puts his case for final relief.\n8 Mr Kallinicos asserts that, in about June 1994, he and Mr Hunt agreed that they or corporations in which they, or members of their family, were interested would acquire\nvarious properties from time to time and resell them, with or without development, for profit, and share the profits and losses equally. It is this business that Mr Kallinicos\ncontends constituted \"the partnership business\"\n.\n9 Various properties were acquired for the purpose of the business, including, relevantly, land at 1/11 Marshall Street, Surry Hills (being lots 1 and 2 in DP 1012198), known as\nthe Abbco site. Mr Kallinicos alleges that, in or about June 1996, Chepan (controlled by Mr Kallinicos) and Dibsenta (controlled by Mr Hunt) agreed that Mr Kallinicos and Mr\nHunt would acquire a company to purchase and develop the Abbco site; that Mr Kallinicos and Mr Hunt themselves, or their nominees, would equally own all the shares in\nthat company; and that the nett proceeds to which each of Chepan and Dibsenta were entitled from the development and sale of a property at Frances Street, Leichhardt\nwould be applied to assist the proposed new company to fund the project. Mr Kallinicos alleges that Rowntree was acquired as the corporate vehicle and that, as the\nbalance proceeds from the Frances Street property ought to have been applied towards the purchase and development of the Abbco site, Rowntree hold so much of those\nproceeds to which Chepan was entitled, or their product in the form of a 50% interest in the Abbco site, upon trust for Chepan, or alternatively as a debt due to Chepan.\n10 Rowntree acquired the Abbco site for a price of $1,750,000 pursuant to a contract made on 29 May 1997, by transfer dated 22 August 1997, and registered 17 September\n1997. The purchase of the Abbco site was financed by a mortgage loan from Esanda Finance Corporation, and from the proceeds of the Frances Street property.\nSubsequently, the development of the site was funded in part from the proceeds of the Frances Street development, and in part by a further mortgage loan, from Perpetual\nTrustee Company Limited. Additional finance was obtained from Advance Investments Finance (No 2) Pty Limited, and from Bendigo Bank Limited. Lot 1/DP1012198 was in\ndue course subdivided into lots 1-14/SP62568; lot 2/DP1012198 was not further subdivided. The strata lots were sold, and the sale of several - but not of lots 3, 11, 12, and 13\n- were completed before November 2001. Mr Moloney acted for Rowntree as vendor on the sales, through his then firm, Eddy & Moloney.\n11 Mr Kallinicos contends that the partnership was terminated on 9 November 2001. On that day, his solicitors, Konstan Lawyers, sent to Mr Hunt a letter, in the following\nterms:-\nWe act for Peter Kallinicos.\nWe are instructed as follows:-\n1. We are instructed that our client entered into a partnership and/or joint venture arrangement whereby our client with his wife Angela Kallinicos entered into various real\nestate projects with yourself and your partner/spouse Kay La Forest.\n2. The purpose of the joint venture was to speculate in property development and property investment.\n3. The partnership/joint venture arrangement involved the use of various vehicles including various \u201cshelf companies\u201d as well as the involvement of client\u2019s wife Angela\nKallinicos nee Vatalis and your spouse Ms Kay La Forest.\n4. We are instructed that our client has given you Notice that he has terminated all past agreements and is desirous in taking accounts of the partnership/business with a\nview to distributing contributions and retained earnings to our client. We are further instructed that you hold all the books and records of the partnership and have refused to\nprovide our client\u2019s accountant access.\n5.

Further, we note that you have failed to pay numerous creditors of the various ventures. Our client\u2019s wife has recently been served with a Statement of Liquidated Claim\nupon BHL Holdings Limited claiming monies for unpaid Liquor purchasers with respect to the business \u201cThe Balmain Monkey Bar\u201d\n. This is unacceptable to our client.\nWe are instructed therefore to demand the following:-\n1. You pay our client within seven (7) days from the date of this letter the sum of $2 million being part payment of our client\u2019s share in the partnership assets.\n2. Provide an account within seven (7) days of all financial dealings including records of all projects undertaken by the partnership; books of accounts; cheque books; Bank\nstatements; records of all loans; capital contribution; payments receipts; an audited record of all expenses paid by the partnership to builders, contractors, employees,\nagents together with a copy of all files including settlement sheets, trust account statements etc.\nWe are instructed that unless our client receives the above information as referred to above, he will approach the Supreme Court of New South Wales and have a Receiver\nappointed to the partnership previously conducted by you and our client.\n12 Eddy & Moloney responded on behalf of Mr Hunt, by letter dated 15 November 2001, reference \u201cPM\u201d (Mr Moloney), as follows:-\nWe refer to the above and confirm that we are the solicitors for Mr Peter Hunt.\nMr Hunt has provided to us a copy of your letter dated 9 November 2001. With respect to that correspondence we are instructed to reply as follows:-\n1. Our respective clients have undertaken a number of joint venture arrangements which were conducted through development companies. A number of those joint ventures\ninvolved the development of real estate.\n2. None of those joint venture arrangements have to date been terminated by either party. In addition no demand has been made on our client by Mr Kallinicos or any other\nparty for production of books of account or associated documentation.\n3. Our client denies that he failed to pay any creditors other than creditors whose claim is disputed. With respect to the claim made by BHL Holdings Limited we confirm\nthat we have received instructions to defend those proceedings on behalf of the first and second defendants.\n4. In order that we might obtain meaningful instructions from our client we would be grateful if you could provide us with specific details of the alleged partnership in\nquestion and the various development projects which were undertaken by that partnership. It is unclear form your correspondence what projects you refer to or whether the\nrelationship between our respective clients was that of a partnership or joint venturers. In circumstances where your client seeks to rely upon written documentation, we\nwould be grateful if you could provide us with a copy of same.\n5. Our clients recently retained new accountants to investigate the books and records of various developments in which your client may have had an involvement.\n6. Your letter dated 9 November 2001 provides no detail whatsoever with respect to any entitlement of your client to the sum of $2,000,000. Whilst our client is more than\nhappy to participate in an accounting of any development project undertaken in association with your client he will not accede to ambit claims without any substantiation\nwhatsoever. We would be grateful if you could advise how your client calculated the figure of $2,000,000.\nAs previously advised our client is not in any way seeking to avoid any responsibilities or obligations which may exist to your client, however, a proper determination needs\nto be made with respect to the existence of any liability. Based upon the contents of your letter dated 9 November 2001, we believe the consideration of an application to\nthe Supreme Court of New South Wales for the appointment of a receiver is grossly premature. In circumstances where any such application is made without providing\nproper notice this letter will be relied upon by the Court in the question of costs.\n13 Thereafter, further strata lots in the Abbco site were sold.

He was not shown to have had notice of, nor to have acquiesced in, the sales of Lots 3, 11, 12, or 13.\nHistory of Proceedings\n19 Mr Kallinicos instituted these proceedings by summons filed on 8 January 2003. On or about 4 February 2003, Mr Moloney filed a notice of appearance, originally on\nbehalf of all five defendants. On 10 July 2003, Mr Kallinicos filed a statement of claim. The proceedings to date have largely involved procedural issues concerning\npleadings and particulars.\n20 On 13 October 2003, Mr Moloney filed a notice of change of solicitor, the effect of which was that he ceased to act for Rowntree (save for a limited purpose, by\narrangement between the parties, which can be disregarded for present purposes), and thereafter acted only for Mr Hunt, Dibsenta, Randall and P&K.\n21 On 26 April 2005, Konstan wrote to Mr Moloney, purporting to challenge his retainer to act for Rowntree (on the basis that Mr Kallinicos, one of the two directors and\nshareholders, had never consented to him so acting), and also suggesting that there was a potential conflict between the interests of Mr Hunt on the one hand and those of\nRowntree on the other, by reason of which it was inappropriate for him to have continued to act for either of them. Mr Moloney replied by letter dated 3 May 2005, asserting\nthat since October 2003, Rowntree had not been represented, and was not represented by him (as a result of the notice of change of solicitor filed on 14 October 2003). He\nsought precise particulars of any objection taken on grounds of conflict.\n22 The present notice of motion, seeking an order restraining Mr Moloney from acting for any of the defendants, was filed on 27 April 2005. Unfiled copies of it and a\nsupporting affidavit had been provided to Mr Moloney on 26 April 2005.\n23 On 28 June 2005, Konstan took issue with Mr Moloney\u2019s denial that he had acted or was acting for Rowntree, but added that Mr Kallinicos not only challenged the\nretainer of Mr Moloney by Rowntree, but also challenged his retainer in respect of others of the defendants:-\nFurther, the flow of funds claimed by our client to have occurred between Dibsenta Pty Limited and Rowntree Properties Pty Ltd when viewed in the context of Mr Moloney\nhaving acted for Rowntree Property Pty Ltd in respect of the transactions which generated those funds, must be such as to put Mr Moloney in a position of conflict in\ncontinuing to act for Mr Hunt and Dibsenta Pty Limited.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5774102-878a-4fcf-a1f6-b7944049c025": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5774102-878a-4fcf-a1f6-b7944049c025", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "43366d89-b860-4b5d-9932-625e8f2b13f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4b1417ae7cfb08890d73d890aa44be83590f222918dc79d883d30d8e06d5660"}, "3": {"node_id": "11bf6d34-3efa-4826-b183-6199f4470563", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f0a5b25d5d77154820f297b95b524ca08bb13c03d0ab675dddb2057a2aa5ecc"}}, "hash": "d91aebed70e9e6344439ef1eda02d7373878a5d93bd4f7985f9648c45ac4cc92", "text": "Moreover, once it is established that Mr Moloney acted for Rowntree Properties Pty Ltd at some stage, even if he ceased doing so, the fact that he once so acted would\npreclude him from continuing to act for Mr Hunt and Dibsenta Pty Limited.\nIn these circumstances, the notice of motion challenging Mr Moloney\u2019s retainer in respect of those parties is being relisted forthwith.\n24 Although, as I have recorded, unfiled copies had been provided on 26 April 2005, the notice of motion, which had originally been filed on 27 April 2005, together with the\naffidavit of Mr Kallinicos sworn 26 April 2005, was formally served under cover of a letter dated 28 June 2005 from Konstan to Mr Moloney. On 4 July 2005, the Registrar by\nconsent directed that the plaintiffs file and serve any further affidavit material in support of the notice of motion by 8 July, and that the first to fourth defendants serve any\nmaterial with respect thereto by 29 July, and stood the matter over for further directions or referral to the Duty Judge on 5 August 2005.\n25 By letter dated 14 July 2005 to Konstan, Mr Moloney sought further particulars of the objection to his acting for the defendants other than Rowntree, and in particular\nwhether it was alleged that he was in receipt of confidential information which disentitled him to continue to act for them, and if so what that information was and what the\nalleged prejudice was. If a conflict of interest were asserted, he asked that it be identified, and if the injunction was sought on some other basis, he sought particulars of the\nobjection.\n26 Konstan replied, ultimately by letter dated 3 August 2005. In essence, the allegation particularised was that Mr Moloney having acted for Rowntree as vendor on the\nsales of lots 3, 11, 12 and 13 at Marshall Street, the balance proceeds of which were distributed to Mr Hunt's interests to the exclusion of Mr Kallinicos' interests, he might\nbe, at least, a material witness, as to how and why those distributions were made, including the source and nature of the instructions for the directions for payment. To this\nwas added that there was no evidence of Mr Kallinicos having consented to Mr Moloney acting for any of the defendants of which he was a director, and that there was the\npotential for conflict between at least the interests of Dibsenta and Randall on the one hand, and Rowntree on the others, and also between the right of Mr Kallinicos to\ninformation as a director of the fifth defendant, and the interests of the other defendants in relation to that information about the unit sales.\n27 The plaintiffs filed an amended statement of claim on 19 July 2005. On 27 July 2005, Eddy & Moloney produced to the court on subpoena conveyancing files relating to\nthe sales on which they had acted, and on 5 August 2005 the Registrar stood the motion over to 5 September 2005 for hearing.\nIssues\n28 In respect of P&K, Mr Burton SC, who appears for Mr Kallinicos, submitted that while there was no suggestion that Mr Moloney had acted for it on the sale of any\nrelevant unit, there was nonetheless potential for a conflict between Dibsenta (which had received some relevant sale proceeds) and P&K (for which he remains on the\nrecord), in circumstances where Mr Kallinicos seeks leave, pursuant to Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), ss 236 and 237, to bring proceedings against Mr Hunt to account for\nthe proceeds of sale by P&K of properties at 270 and 442 Darling Street, Balmain. Moreover, he submits that there is no evidence that the retainer of Mr Moloney was ever\nduly authorised by P&K, of which Mr Kallinicos and his wife are two of the four directors and Mr Kallinicos an equal shareholder with Mr Hunt. For Mr Moloney and his\npresent clients, Mr Ireland QC says that it has been apparent that he has been acting for P&K from the outset; that he ceased to act for Rowntree when the issue as to\nauthority or retainer was raised in respect of it; and that if similar objection were taken in respect of P&K, then the appropriate course was that P&K be unrepresented. He\nacknowledged that Mr Moloney might not be able to sustain a retainer by the fourth defendant, in which case it should be left unrepresented.\n29 If Mr Moloney\u2019s actions for P&K were the only issue, that would resolve the present application, but it is not.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11bf6d34-3efa-4826-b183-6199f4470563": {"__data__": {"id_": "11bf6d34-3efa-4826-b183-6199f4470563", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5774102-878a-4fcf-a1f6-b7944049c025", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d91aebed70e9e6344439ef1eda02d7373878a5d93bd4f7985f9648c45ac4cc92"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0034fbc-a66b-4590-9f60-1bd7ad3f0461", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3472cbccd2ac7049ed8c795dd0a071ba91bea1063b96122ef80a366dde99b0e7"}}, "hash": "7f0a5b25d5d77154820f297b95b524ca08bb13c03d0ab675dddb2057a2aa5ecc", "text": "Mr Burton contends that there is a significant risk that Mr\nMoloney, the solicitor on the record for the defendants other than Rowntree, either will be a material witness, or, if he is not called by the defendants, the fact that he is the\nsolicitor acting for Dibsenta, Randall and P&K may be a matter of some forensic embarrassment. He submits that there is a live issue as to the disbursement of the nett\nproceeds of two of the strata units to Dibsenta, and of one to Randall, and that it will be material to explore the source and nature of instructions which Mr Moloney\nreceived for the directions as to payment upon completion; also that it will be material to explore the source and nature of his instructions for the disbursement to the three\npersons who each received $43,000. He submits that who gave such instructions, and their content and context, will be relevant, and also that the plaintiffs may wish to\ntest the bona fides of Mr Hunt and any assertion he makes about those payments, by eliciting evidence of what he may have told Mr Moloney. Thus, says Mr Burton, if Mr\nMoloney\u2019s explanation were the innocent one (from his perspective) that he sent the transfers to Mr Hunt for execution and received instructions from Mr Hunt that they had\nbeen duly executed and that Mr Hunt and Mr Kallinicos were agreed as to the directions as to payment, even that would be important evidence against Mr Hunt.\n30 Mr Burton also points to the circumstance that over the period from June to November 2002 during which the four transfers in question took place, their execution\nevolved from the transfer of Lot 3 (in which the affixation of the seal of Rowntree was purportedly attested by the two directors), through the transfers of lots 11 and 12 (in\nwhich the attestation of the seal was apparently attested by one director (Mr Hunt) and an unauthorised person (Ms La Forest)), until the transfer of lot 13 (which was\npurportedly executed by Mr Hunt as sole director), (which he never was), all these being handled by the same solicitor on the record. It is implicit in Mr Burton's submission\nthat from the dissolution of the partnership and these facts, Mr Moloney ought to have been alerted to the possibility that the interests of Mr Kallinicos were being\ndisregarded.\nJurisdiction to restrain lawyers from acting\n31 Mr Burton's submissions did not invoke the power of the court to restrain a solicitor from acting due to the risk of imperilling confidences of a former client. Rather, he\nrelied on what is said to be the broader scope of the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction to preserve the proper administration of justice by restraining a legal practitioner from\nacting in a particular case, for which he referred to Bowen v Stott [2004] WASC 94 (Hasluck J), [51]; Re LPO Transact Pty Ltd (In Liq); Williamson v Nilant [2002] WASC 225\n(McKechnie J), [25]; and Holborow v Rudder [2002] WASC 265 (Heenan J). Mr Ireland emphasised that the application was apparently not based on the proposition that Mr\nMoloney was in possession of any information confidential to the plaintiffs, but on the possibility that he may be a material witness.\n32 The acceptance in New South Wales of the authority of Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG [1998] UKHL 52; [1999] 2 AC 222 for the view that, in a case where the retainer is no\nlonger active, the jurisdiction of the court to intervene at the suit of a former client to restrain a solicitor from acting is founded solely on obligations of confidence, and is not\nand cannot be connected with some principle of conflict of interest [Prince Jefri, 234-5; Belan v Casey [2002] NSWSC 58 (Young CJ in Eq), [15]-[21]; British American\nTobacco Australia Services Limited v Blanch [2004] NSWSC 70 (Young CJ in Eq), [97]-[104]; Asia Pacific Telecommunications Limited v Optus Networks Pty Limited [2005]\nNSWSC 550 (Bergin J), [51]-[55]], requires that closer consideration be given to the nature of the jurisdiction which Mr Burton\u2019s submissions invoke, and in particular,\nwhether it survives in New South Wales.\n33 As Young CJ in Eq pointed out in Belan v Casey, [15], until Prince Jefri three bases were advanced for granting injunctions restraining solicitors from acting in\nproceedings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0034fbc-a66b-4590-9f60-1bd7ad3f0461": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0034fbc-a66b-4590-9f60-1bd7ad3f0461", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "11bf6d34-3efa-4826-b183-6199f4470563", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f0a5b25d5d77154820f297b95b524ca08bb13c03d0ab675dddb2057a2aa5ecc"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8a496e5-e7cc-4200-a9ad-84588a9599f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cebcd985f46b848568de9ba5769bb0f5b7895c5548bbf0736dc0ac28b3806918"}}, "hash": "3472cbccd2ac7049ed8c795dd0a071ba91bea1063b96122ef80a366dde99b0e7", "text": "The first was a breach of confidence, where to permit the solicitor to continue to act (usually, though not invariably, against a former client) would involve a risk\nthat the solicitor might use, or be bound to use, information which he or she held subject to a duty of confidence to the former client. The second was breach of a duty of\nloyalty, where acting against a former client was said to be inconsistent with the solicitor\u2019s fiduciary obligation of loyalty to that former client. The third was the court\u2019s\ninherent supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors.\n34 The first basis \u2013 breach of confidence \u2013 involves a claim to enforce a contractual or equitable right, namely, the protection of a confidence which the solicitor was bound,\nby the contract of retainer and/or in equity, to maintain, even after termination of the retainer. It depends on ordinary contractual and equitable principles. The second was\nalso framed as depending on ordinary equitable principles, said to be derived from a solicitor\u2019s fiduciary duty. Thus each of the first two bases involved the assertion of legal\nrights which might as easily arise in relationships other than between solicitor and client (for example, as in Prince Jefri, between accountant and client). The third basis was\nquite different, depending not at all upon equitable (or other) rights of the parties, but on the court\u2019s inherent supervisory jurisdiction over its officers, including its solicitors.\nIt is that third basis for intervention that the plaintiffs seek to invoke in this case.\n35 The importance of Prince Jefri was in clarifying and distinguishing the basis for the Court's intervention in each of an \u201cexisting client\u201d case, and a \u201cformer client\u201d case.\nLord Millett affirmed the basis of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to intervene at the suit of a former client to be the protection of confidences, and not the avoidance of any\nperception of possible impropriety [Prince Jefri, 234F-H]. In a former client case, the court\u2019s jurisdiction could not be based on any conflict of interest, because there was\nnone: the fiduciary relationship formerly subsisting between solicitor and client had come to an end with the termination of the retainer, and the solicitor thereafter had no\nobligation to defend and advance the interests of the former client, to whom the only surviving duty was one to preserve the confidentiality of information imparted during\nthe subsistence of the relationship [Prince Jefri, 235C-D]. Prince Jefri holds that a former client who seeks to restrain its former solicitor from acting against it must show (i)\nthat the solicitor is in possession of the former client's confidential information, to the disclosure of which the former client has not consented, and (ii) that the information is\nor may be relevant to the new matter, in which the interests of the solicitor's new client may be adverse to those of the former client [Prince Jefri, 235D-E]. On the other\nhand, where the court\u2019s intervention is sought by an existing client, the solicitor\u2019s disqualification from acting has nothing to do with the confidentiality of client information,\nbut is based on the inescapable conflict of interest (to use Lord Millett\u2019s word, but perhaps \u201cduty\u201d is more pertinent) inherent in the situation of acting both for and against\nthe same person [Prince Jefri, 234I-235A].\n36 Does Prince Jefri deny the availability of the court\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction to restrain a solicitor from acting against a former client other than where confidences are put\nin jeopardy?\n37 Before Prince Jefri, the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction to restrain a solicitor from acting in a particular case as part of its supervisory jurisdiction was well-established, as the\nfollowing, far from exhaustive, review of the authorities shows.\n38 In Davies v Clough [1837] EngR 360; (1837) 8 Sim 262; 59 ER 105, albeit that questions of confidential information arose, Shadwell VC, in a judgment which was affirmed\nby Lord Cottenham LC, founded the jurisdiction to intervene on the Court's authority over its own officers as to the propriety of their behaviour.\n39 In Mills v Day Dawn Bloch Gold Mining Co Limited (1882) 1 QLJ 62, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland, albeit in a case concerning confidential\ninformation, held that the jurisdiction to restrain a solicitor from acting against a former client rested on the power of the court to keep control over all its officers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8a496e5-e7cc-4200-a9ad-84588a9599f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8a496e5-e7cc-4200-a9ad-84588a9599f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0034fbc-a66b-4590-9f60-1bd7ad3f0461", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3472cbccd2ac7049ed8c795dd0a071ba91bea1063b96122ef80a366dde99b0e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7852fa7-76d2-4297-bb99-b6d3509dde58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "97854b3d267313f188cb78cabe5b89c9eb57701dbc626cadc43f6a12d5f9cab4"}}, "hash": "cebcd985f46b848568de9ba5769bb0f5b7895c5548bbf0736dc0ac28b3806918", "text": "40 In Rakusen v Ellis Munday and Clarke [1912] 1 Ch 831, Cozens-Hardy MR [at 835] referred to \u201cthe special jurisdiction over solicitors\u201d\n, Fletcher-Moulton LJ [at 841]\nmentioned \u201cthe power that we certainly possess of directing what the officers of the court should and should not do\u201d\n, and Buckley LJ [at 843] referred to the jurisdiction\nover solicitors as officers of the court.\n41 In Abse v Smith [1986] QB 536, Donaldson MR [at 546] referred to the inherent right of a court, incidental to the proper administration of justice, to refuse to hear any\nindividual barrister or solicitor when the proper administration of justice necessitates it.\n42 In Wan v McDonald [1992] FCA 4; (1992) 33 FCR 491, Burchett J said [at 512-513] that while the emphasis in earlier judgments had been on the solicitor\u2019s duty to\nsafeguard confidential information, recent attention had been drawn to at least two other aspects of the problem: a solicitor\u2019s duty of loyalty which could not be treated as\nextinguished by the mere termination of the period of the retainer, and the important consideration of public policy which gives a special quality to the relationship of\nsolicitor and client that the law will not generally permit to be stained by the appearance of disloyalty.\n43 In Everingham v Ontario (1992) 88 DLR (4th) 755, the Full Court of the Ontario Divisional Court [at 761-762] held that it was within the inherent jurisdiction of a superior\ncourt to deny the right of audience to counsel when the interests of justice so required by reason of conflict or otherwise, and that this power did not depend on the rules of\nprofessional conduct made by the legal profession and was not limited to cases in which those rules were breached. The issue was not whether a rule was breached, but\nwhether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice required the removal of the solicitor, the goal\nbeing to protect not just the interests of the individual litigant but more importantly public confidence in the administration of justice.\n44 In Black v Taylor [1993] 3 NZLR 403, the New Zealand Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a declaration that a solicitor should not act further as counsel in certain\nproceedings on the ground of conflict of interest arising from the solicitor\u2019s past receipt of confidential information, but did so on a basis which did not rest on protection of\nconfidential information. Cooke P said [at 406] that the inherent jurisdiction of courts to determine who may be allowed to represent parties to argue cases before them\nextended to the propriety of a representative appearing in a particular case, which pertained not to the right of practice generally, but to what was needed or may be\npermitted to ensure in a particular case both justice and the appearance of justice; though the jurisdiction was one to be exercised with circumspection. Richardson J [at\n408-409] said that the court had an inherent jurisdiction to control its own processes, which included determining who should be permitted to appear before it as\nadvocates, one aspect of which was the control of a particular proceeding in the court. His Honour described the right to choice of counsel as an important but not an\nabsolute value. After reference to Everingham v Ontario, his Honour held that where it was satisfied that the interests of justice so required, the High Court had an inherent\njurisdiction to restrain a barrister from continuing to act as counsel for a particular party in proceedings before the court. His Honour agreed with the approach of the\nOntario court, holding that disqualification (in a particular case) would ordinarily be the appropriate remedy where the integrity of the judicial process would be impaired by\ncounsel\u2019s adversarial representation of one party against the other [at 42]:\nThe decision to disqualify is not dependent on any finding of culpable conduct on the lawyer\u2019s part. Disqualification is not imposed as a punishment for misconduct. Rather\nit is a protection for the parties and for the wider interests of justice. The legitimacy of judicial decisions depends in large part on the observance of the standards of\nprocedural justice. Where the integrity of the judicial process is perceived to be at risk from the proposed or continuing representation by counsel on behalf of one party,\ndisqualification is the obvious and in some cases the only effective remedy although considerations of delay, inconvenience and expense arising from a change in\nrepresentation may be important in determining in particular cases whether the interests of justice truly demand disqualification.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7852fa7-76d2-4297-bb99-b6d3509dde58": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7852fa7-76d2-4297-bb99-b6d3509dde58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8a496e5-e7cc-4200-a9ad-84588a9599f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cebcd985f46b848568de9ba5769bb0f5b7895c5548bbf0736dc0ac28b3806918"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c4ee1d0-9652-4a6e-86b9-22b620ba6e53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84feb41c234075b0ae0df690e1ec34fa2c4960acbf80262f2fc9d661fa209527"}}, "hash": "97854b3d267313f188cb78cabe5b89c9eb57701dbc626cadc43f6a12d5f9cab4", "text": "45 In Kooky Garments Limited v Charlton [1994] 1 NZLR 587, Thomas J said that the court had an inherent jurisdiction to supervise the conduct of counsel in court, which\nincluded the ability to intervene when counsel or solicitors appeared in a matter in which they had an actual or potential conflict of interest, or where, by reason of their\nrelationship with the client their professional independence might be doubted - because the integrity of the judicial process is undermined if the lawyers do not have the\nindependence and objectivity which they are presumed to have.\n46 In Grimwade v Meagher [1995] VicRp 28; [1995] 1 VR 446, Mandie J held that the court had inherent jurisdiction to ensure the due administration of justice and to protect\nthe integrity of the judicial process, and as a part of that jurisdiction to prevent counsel appearing for a particular party in order that justice not only be done but be seen to\nbe done. His Honour said that the objective test to be applied was whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper\nadministration of justice required that counsel be prevented from acting, giving due weight to the public interest that litigants should not be deprived of their counsel of\nchoice without good cause. In what his Honour described as the \u201cunique, extraordinary and highly exceptional circumstances\u201d of that case, a sufficient real and sensible\nrisk of a lack of objectivity by counsel was found to give rise not only to an undue risk of unfairness or disadvantage to the plaintiff, but also to a substantial concern that a\nfair trial would not be had, and thus to a concern for the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice.\n47 In Yunghanns v Elfic Limited (VSC, 3 July 1998, Gillard J, unreported), Gillard J thought that the authorities established three bases for the grant of a injunction to restrain\na solicitor acting against his former client: protection of confidences; breach of fiduciary obligations of trust and integrity; and the administration of justice. With respect to\nthe third basis his Honour said [at 9] that the court had an inherent power to control and deal with members of the legal profession and to ensure that the administration of\njustice was not brought into disrepute by the conduct of members of the profession.\n48 Prince Jefri was a \u201cformer client\u201d case. Significantly for present purposes, it concerned accountants, not solicitors, although their Lordships\u2019 speeches are expressed in\nterms which relate to solicitors, and it was accepted that accountants providing litigation support services should be treated for relevant purposes in the same way as a\nsolicitor. As the question of confidential information was at the heart of Prince Jefri, that assumption was an appropriate one in that context. Lord Hope of Craighead\nconsidered that the nature of the work which a firm of accountants undertakes in the provision of litigation support services required the court to exercise the same\njurisdiction to intervene on behalf of a former client as it exercises in the case of a solicitor, the basis of that jurisdiction being found in the principles which apply to all forms\nof employment where the relationship between the client and the person with whom he does business is a confidential one [Prince Jefri, 226H-227A]. His Lordship\u2019s\napplication to accountants of the jurisdiction relating to solicitors was thus plainly in the context of the protection of confidential information. Lord Millett, with whom Lords\nBrowne-Wilkinson, Clyde and Hutton agreed, said that the duties of an accountant could not be greater than those of a solicitor and may be less, but that insofar as some\nof the information obtained by KPMG was likely to have attracted litigation privilege though not solicitor/client privilege, it was conceded by KPMG that an accountant\nproviding litigation support services must be treated for present purposes in the same way as a solicitor [Prince Jefri, 234C-D]. Again, this application to accountants of the\nrules relating to solicitors was plainly in the context of confidential or privileged information.\n49 Accountants are not officers of the court, and are not subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the court to which its officers are subject. The court\u2019s inherent supervisory\njurisdiction over its officers, including its solicitors was not relevant to Prince Jefri and was not considered in it. In limiting the basis on which a former client could have a\nsolicitor restrained from acting for another to the protection of confidential information, the House of Lords should be taken as having done so to the exclusion of\nenforcement of any supposed duty of loyalty. However, their Lordships should not be taken as having excluded the court\u2019s inherent supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c4ee1d0-9652-4a6e-86b9-22b620ba6e53": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c4ee1d0-9652-4a6e-86b9-22b620ba6e53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7852fa7-76d2-4297-bb99-b6d3509dde58", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "97854b3d267313f188cb78cabe5b89c9eb57701dbc626cadc43f6a12d5f9cab4"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e42011f-e672-4e62-a0c5-f32a64318691", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a993f4b1a533e732526ece7e9841c48b18401d88323e8bc529479c871a4c9b75"}}, "hash": "84feb41c234075b0ae0df690e1ec34fa2c4960acbf80262f2fc9d661fa209527", "text": "50 Many subsequent authorities have maintained the same view of the supervisory jurisdiction as appears in the cases before Prince Jefri.\n51 In McVeigh v Linen House Pty Ltd [1999] VSCA 138; [1999] 3 VR 394, Batt JA (albeit in a judgment in which Prince Jefri was not cited) said that the authorities established\nthat a court would restrain a solicitor from acting for a litigant, not only in order to prevent disclosure of confidences of a client or former client, but also to ensure that the\nsolicitor\u2019s duty of loyalty to the former client was respected notwithstanding termination of the retainer, and to uphold as a matter of public policy the special relationship of\nsolicitor and client.\n52 In Oceanic Life Limited v HIH Casualty and General Insurance Limited [1999] NSWSC 272, Austin J said [at 48] that, in addition to fiduciary duties and the duty not to\nmisuse confidential information, a solicitor acting in litigation owed a relevant legal duty to the court as well as an ethical duty:-\n[48] The duty to the court arises from the court\u2019s concern that it should have the assistance of independent legal representation for the litigating parties: see D A Ipp,\n\u201cLawyers\u2019 Duties to the Court\u201d (1998) 114 LQR 63, 93. In the realm of conflicts of interest and conflicts of duty, the solicitor\u2019s duty to the court may not be much different from\nhis or her fiduciary duties to former and present clients. However, the duty to the court tends to be expressed in such a way as to emphasise the public interest in\npreserving confidence in the administration of justice, and therefore in the appearance as well as the reality of independence, and the court\u2019s practical approach to its\nsupervisory discretions: Fruehauf Finance Corp Pty Ltd v Feez Ruthning [1991] 1 QdR 558; Murray v Macquarie Bank Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 46; Carindale Country Club Estate Pty\nLtd v Astill [1993] FCA 218; (1993) 42 FCR 307; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Myer [1994] VicRp 22; [1994] VR 350; Kooky Garments Limited v Charlton [1994] 1 NZLR 587; Watson v\nWatson (SCNSW, Santow J, unreported, 25 May 1998).\n53 In Newman v Phillips Fox [1999] WASC 171, Steytler J granted an injunction restraining Phillips Fox, a law firm, from representing its client corporation in an arbitration,\nand from disclosing to that corporation certain confidential information which had earlier been provided by the other parties to the arbitration to a firm which had\nsubsequently merged with Phillips Fox. His Honour identified that there had traditionally been three bases for intervention by the court in applications of this kind: the\nprotection of confidential information, restraint of a breach of fiduciary duty in the context of a conflict of interest, and the court\u2019s control over the conduct of solicitors as its\nofficers. Of the third, his Honour said:-\n[21] As to the third of the bases mentioned above, while it might be so that the basis for the court\u2019s intervention has, more recently in England, not been that of a possible\nperception of impropriety (see, in this respect, what was said by Lightman J in Re A Firm of Solicitors, above [1997] Ch at 9, and again by Lord Millett in [Prince Jefri]\nBolkiah, above at 224), the jurisdiction to exercise authority over officers of the court as to the propriety of their behaviour has long been recognised both in England and\nelsewhere. Thus, in Davies v Clough [1837] EngR 360; (1937) 8 Sim 262; 59 ER 105 Sir Lancelot Shadwell VC said (at 267; 106-107):-\nThe cases ... appear to afford this general principle, namely, that all courts may exercise an authority over their own officers as to the propriety of their behaviour: for\napplications have been repeatedly made to restrain solicitors who had acted on one side, from acting on the other, and those applications have failed or succeeded upon\ntheir own particular grounds, but never because the court had no jurisdiction.\n(See also Re A Solicitor [1987] 131 SJ 1063).\n[22] In Australia the courts have, on a number of occasions, shown a willingness to intervene upon this third basis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e42011f-e672-4e62-a0c5-f32a64318691": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e42011f-e672-4e62-a0c5-f32a64318691", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c4ee1d0-9652-4a6e-86b9-22b620ba6e53", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84feb41c234075b0ae0df690e1ec34fa2c4960acbf80262f2fc9d661fa209527"}, "3": {"node_id": "9db5d0a3-313e-4369-94a0-4e17ba8affd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9aa02faadeb204cbc487cd0783d1ae45d3fd621456cbe396751447eac6f7c176"}}, "hash": "a993f4b1a533e732526ece7e9841c48b18401d88323e8bc529479c871a4c9b75", "text": "So, for example, in Yunghanns above at 9, Gillard J\naffirmed that the court has an inherent power to control and deal with members of the legal profession and to ensure that the administration of justice is not brought into\ndisrepute by the conduct of those members (see also in Re J A Grieve [1861] 1 WWL 197).\n54 His Honour referred to observations by Drummond J, in Carindale Country Club Estate Pty Ltd v Astill [1993] FCA 218; (1993) 42 FCR 307 [at 311], that there is a public\nelement in the work that a solicitor does as an officer of the court and thus performing an integral part in the administration of justice, and to the observations mentioned\nabove of Austin J in Oceanic Life v HIH Casualty and General, before concluding that there was sufficient foundation for intervention not only on the first but also on the\nthird of the bases mentioned.\n55 In Mitchell v Pattern Holdings Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 1015, Bergin J refused an application by the defendant for an order that the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors cease to act. Her\nHonour noted observations of Mandie J in Tricontinental Corporation Limited v Holding Redlich (VSC, Mandie J, 22 December 1994), in which his Honour had said that it\nwas a serious matter to prevent a party from retaining the legal representative of its choice, particularly upon the application not of a former client but of an adverse party.\nHer Honour also referred to Grimwade v Meagher, but thought the circumstances very distinguishable. Nonetheless, her Honour affirmed the availability in an appropriate\ncase of the supervisory jurisdiction [at 34]:-\nI am of the view that as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction, this court may decide upon the propriety of a legal practitioner representing a party in a particular case to\nensure justice and the appearance of justice. It has been said that such jurisdiction should be exercised with circumspection: Black v Taylor [1993] 3 NZLR 403 per Cooke P\nat 406; State of Western Australia v Ward and ors [1997] FCA 585; (1997) 145 ALR 512 per Hill and Sundberg JJ at 518-519.\n56 Prince Jefri was cited, and it does not appear to have been suggested that it excluded the third basis for intervention.\n57 In Spincode Pty Ltd v Look Software Pty Ltd [2001] VSCA 248; (2001) 4 VR 501, the Victorian Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the grant of an injunction at the\nsuit of defendants in proceedings, restraining a firm of solicitors from acting or continuing to act for the plaintiff. The principal basis for the decision was that it was a clear\ncase of confidential information relevant to the matters in dispute having been received by the solicitors from the defendants, and that not only had it not been shown that\nthere was no real risk of misuse of that information, but there was a real and sensible possibility of such misuse.\n58 However, Brooking JA went further. His Honour concluded that, since the earliest days of attempts to prevent solicitors acting against former clients, one basis of the\njurisdiction has been the inherent jurisdiction which the court has over solicitors as its officers [Spincode, 511 [32]]. Brooking JA observed that the supervisory jurisdiction\nhad not been discussed in Prince Jefri [at 514 [37]]:-\nIn [Prince Jefri] Bolkiah the House of Lords disposed of the question whether a basis could be found for restraining a solicitor from acting against a former client other than\nthe protection of confidential information without discussing it at any length. Quite apart from decisions in the United States there is and was a considerable body of\nauthority bearing on that question. I have already drawn attention to some of the many cases which accept that, where a solicitor is an officer of the court, the jurisdiction of\nthe court to restrain the solicitor form acting may be founded not only on the general power which a court exercising equitable jurisdiction has to grant injunctions for the\nprotection of a right but also on the control which a court may exercise over its own officers. Lord Eldon himself was one of the first to speak of this other jurisdiction, and\nhe seems to have been the first to raise the procedural question whether it could be exercised in a cause, in the absence of objection from the solicitor to a defect in the\nprocedure. It may be argued that the existence of the special jurisdiction over officers of the court is not inconsistent with the view that the only basis on which that\njurisdiction will be exercised is the existence of a right to prevent the misuse of confidential information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9db5d0a3-313e-4369-94a0-4e17ba8affd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9db5d0a3-313e-4369-94a0-4e17ba8affd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e42011f-e672-4e62-a0c5-f32a64318691", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a993f4b1a533e732526ece7e9841c48b18401d88323e8bc529479c871a4c9b75"}, "3": {"node_id": "05b73b5d-f22b-4c5d-a79c-bf2f29b9a46a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f349c33d7a9d0ba687e60d516172510831df7b31bc39aa37260b1883f2415c44"}}, "hash": "9aa02faadeb204cbc487cd0783d1ae45d3fd621456cbe396751447eac6f7c176", "text": "On the other hand, it may be said that the nature and object of the\njurisdiction exercised over officers of the court are such as to prevent it being so confined.\n[38] There is a good deal of authority for the view that a solicitor, as an officer of the court, may be prevented from acting against a former client even though a likelihood of\ndanger of misuse of confidential information is not shown. ...\n59 His Honour\u2019s examination [at 508-511, [26]\u2013[31]] of Earl Cholmondeley v Lord Clinton [1815] EngR 511; (1815) 19 Ves Jun 261; 34 ER 515, shows that it is at best unclear that\nLord Eldon\u2019s decision was dependant upon the apprehended misuse of confidential information, though at least in one later case Lord Eldon suggested that it was\n[Bricheno v Thorp [1821] EngR 542; (1821) Jac 300, 301; [1821] EngR 542; 37 ER 864, 865], and it seems to have been treated as dependant on misuse of confidential\ninformation in Rakusen v Ellis.

[An appeal from his Honour\u2019s decision to the Full Court succeeded [Williamson v Metaxas &\nVernon [2004] WASCA 248], but the Full Court accepted the test and principles to be as stated by McKechnie J, though differing in their application to the facts of the\nparticular case].\n63 In Holborow, Heenan J dismissed an application by the defendant to restrain a solicitor from acting for the plaintiffs, in circumstances that he was not in fact acting for\nthem though he had previously done so, and it was sought to prevent him from having any communication at all with his former clients, advising them in any way, or taking\nany part in the proceedings except as a witness.

It is an ample power to supervise the conduct of\nlegal practitioners, as officers of the Court, to ensure that they do not act in any way contrary to their obligations to their former client. The broader scope of this power has\nfrequently been referred to as ensuring \u201cthat the solicitor\u2019s duty of loyalty to the former client is respected, notwithstanding termination of the retainer, and to uphold as a\nmatter of public policy the special relationship of solicitor and client\u201d\n- McVeigh v Linen House Pty Ltd [1993] 3 VR 394 per Batt JA at 398 and Wan v McDonald [1992] FCA\n4; (1992) 33 FCR 491 per Burchett J at 513. Examples of this are to be found in Clay v Karlson (1997) 17 WAR 493; Afkos Industries Pty Ltd v Pullinger Stewart [2001] WASCA\n372 and Re LPO Transact Pty Ltd (In Liq); Williamson v Nilant [2002] WASC 225. In those cases legal practitioners were restrained from acting in various instances where:\nthere was a potential that the legal practitioner might be a witness in the case; where the subject matter of the litigation was likely to involve an evaluation of the conduct of\nthe solicitor concerned and the efficacy of documents prepared by his firm; and where a solicitor was acting for a liquidator in connection with the liquidator\u2019s investigations\ninto the prior activities of an insolvent company where the solicitor had, prior to the insolvency, been acting for the company. In some of these cases it is obviously apposite\nto speak of the solicitor\u2019s duty of loyalty to the client which continues even after the termination of the period of his retainer. This seems to be a broad general recognition of\nthe scope of the duties which a solicitor owes to a client, even a former client, arising from the fiduciary relationship between them.\n...\n[26] Consequently, when an application is made to restrain a legal practitioner from acting in a cause for reasons other than the risk of disclosure or misuse of information\nprovided to the practitioner in confidence by the former client, it is of importance to identify precisely what obligation towards the former client or to the court may be\nbreached or imperilled by the practitioner acting in the cause or against the former client. This approach is important because, otherwise, there may imperceptibly develop\nan expectation that the freedom of a client to engage a legal practitioner of his or her own preference, and the freedom of a legal practitioner to act even against a former\nclient, where such a course does not involve any breach of his fiduciary obligations arising from the earlier retainer, is open to adventitious challenge as a means of\nharassing an opponent in a cause.\n64 After referring to the words of Mason J in Giannarelli v Wraith [1988] HCA 52; (1988) 165 CLR 543, [555-556] in which the paramount duty of counsel to the court and its\nincidents were outlined, his Honour described the test under the third basis for intervention as depending on objective perception of a want of independence:-\n[28] If there are circumstances which are likely to imperil the discharge of these duties to a court by a legal practitioner acting in a cause, whether because of some prior\nassociation with one or more of the parties against whom the practitioner is then to act, or because of some conduct by the practitioner, whether arising from associations\nwith the client or a close interest which gives rise to the fair and reasonable perception that the practitioner may not exercise the necessary independent judgment, a court\nmay conclude that the lawyer should be restrained from acting, even for a client who desires to continue his service \u2013 Clay v Karlson; Wan v McDonald [1992] FCA 4; (1992)\n33 FCR 491; National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corp (1989) 22 FCR 209 and Afkos Industries Pty Ltd v Pullinger Stewart [2001] WASCA 372.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83260217-fba5-4cd3-ae38-1b3aa5efc857": {"__data__": {"id_": "83260217-fba5-4cd3-ae38-1b3aa5efc857", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "05b73b5d-f22b-4c5d-a79c-bf2f29b9a46a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f349c33d7a9d0ba687e60d516172510831df7b31bc39aa37260b1883f2415c44"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a303cc3-71dd-4e49-bcb1-13031961081a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b725a3d0f02012e6d3e75e5417dbe51d33ce5bfe68a126674e7917de5c27219"}}, "hash": "163883f4a8eb68de7cf8965bfe8b6690afa931a5a6bafec1d244a4d7539fec52", "text": "65 In Belan v Casey, Young CJ in Eq dismissed an application by a defendant for orders that the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors, who had previously acted for both parties as\ndefendants in defamation proceedings against them, be restrained from acting for the plaintiff against him in proceedings in which the plaintiff sought contribution to the\nadverse judgment in the defamation proceedings. His Honour said that, until Prince Jefri, courts had gleaned three bases for granting injunctions restraining solicitors from\ncontinuing to act: breach of a duty of confidence, breach of a duty of loyalty, and the inherent jurisdiction over solicitors; but that in Prince Jefri the House of Lords had held\nthat in a case where the retainer was no longer active, jurisdiction was founded solely on confidential information and was not connected with any principle of conflict of\ninterest. Observing that Prince Jefri decided two points - (1) that the basis of the claim (in a former client case) was the duty of confidence, and (2) that it was sufficient for a\nplaintiff to demonstrate a real and not fanciful risk of disclosure - his Honour said that Prince Jefri had been followed on almost every occasion, except in Victoria, though\nmainly in respect of the second proposition. His Honour concluded that, since Prince Jefri \u201cthe overwhelming weight of authority is to the effect that where the applicant to\nrestrain a solicitor is a former client, the sole consideration is whether there is a real risk of disclosure of confidential information and one does not delve into matters of\nconflict of interest or conflict of duty. In other situations this delving may be material\u201d\n.\n66 I take his Honour to have held that Prince Jefri excludes from consideration, in a \u201cformer client\u201d case, any question of a breach of a duty of loyalty, and to have declined\nto follow Spincode insofar as Brooking JA suggested that in Australia an equitable obligation of loyalty (or even arguably a contractual obligation of loyalty, which Brooking\nJA contemplated) survived termination of the retainer. But I do not take his Honour to have held that the court\u2019s well-established inherent jurisdiction over solicitors no\nlonger extends to restraining a solicitor from acting in a particular case on ground other than threatened breach of confidence. His Honour was applying, but not extending,\nPrince Jefri.\n67 In Photocure ASA v Queens University at Kingston [2002] FCA 905; (2002) 56 IPR 86, Goldberg J took the view of Prince Jefri that it limited the basis of intervention in a\nformer client case to the protection of confidential information and not the existence of a conflict of interest, preferring Belan v Casey to the views of Brooking JA in\nSpincode [53]-[56]. This is probably the strongest direct expression of a view that the supervisory jurisdiction is no longer available.\n68 In Law Society of New South Wales v Holt [2003] NSWSC 629, Grove J declined to grant an injunction restraining a solicitor who had been employed by the Law Society\nfrom acting for the defendant solicitor in a disciplinary matter. His Honour cited the observations of Bergin J in Mitchell v Pattern Holdings as authority for the existence of\njurisdiction to make the order sought. It will be remembered that those observations expressed the jurisdiction to be an incident of the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction, to ensure\njustice and the appearance of justice. His Honour referred to Prince Jefri on the extent of the duty to protect confidential information and the circumstances in which a court\nwould intervene, but plainly did not read it as excluding the third basis of intervention.\n69 In British American Tobacco, Young CJ in Eq was asked to reconsider what his Honour had said in Belan v Casey, but adhered the same view [[101] \u2013 [104]]. The applicant\nhad contended that it was entitled to an injunction first, on the basis of the solicitor\u2019s fiduciary obligations; secondly, on the basis of a contractual duty of loyalty surviving\nthe termination of the retainer; and thirdly, on the basis of the court\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction [34].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a303cc3-71dd-4e49-bcb1-13031961081a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a303cc3-71dd-4e49-bcb1-13031961081a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "83260217-fba5-4cd3-ae38-1b3aa5efc857", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "163883f4a8eb68de7cf8965bfe8b6690afa931a5a6bafec1d244a4d7539fec52"}, "3": {"node_id": "f609cb98-0ca9-4635-a0a2-7cda214c0d1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5d0a68ea415093b576b84b93c781b2e09850f7870f3b38d2faac04992d5a89a"}}, "hash": "4b725a3d0f02012e6d3e75e5417dbe51d33ce5bfe68a126674e7917de5c27219", "text": "While this, and the fact that his Honour recorded the invitation to\nreconsider Belan v Casey in terms \u201cMr Gleeson invited me to reconsider my reasoning in Belan v Casey insofar as I held that only the first of these is available\u201d might\nsuggest that the third basis was raised and rejected, his Honour ultimately decided the case on the first basis alone and, in reviewing Belan v Casey, acknowledged that\nthere might be exceptional cases where equity would give relief in favour of a former client, even though there was no confidential information to be protected, while\nmaintaining that it was clear that there was no rule forbidding a lawyer acting against a former client [105], [112]. I do not read his Honour\u2019s judgment as intending to deny\nthat the court retained inherent jurisdiction in an appropriate case, as an incident of its control of its process and officers, to restrain a solicitor from acting in a particular\ncase. Once again, his Honour was applying, but not extending, Prince Jefri.\n70 In Bowen v Stott, Hasluck J granted an injunction at the suit of the plaintiff restraining the defendants from engaging any solicitor associated with Minter Ellison from\nacting for them, and requiring that Minter Ellison be removed from the record as solicitors for the defendants, finding that there were circumstances which might suggest to\na fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public that, if evidence were given of the kind likely to be given by the legal practitioners involved in the negotiations, a\nconflict of interest might arise which could interfere with the proper administration of justice, because the practitioners might not be able to conduct themselves with proper\nobjectivity. His Honour recorded that while counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that there were three recognised grounds for intervention, reliance on the first two was\neschewed \u2013 the first being protection of confidential information of a former client, where that information might be relevant to a matter in which the solicitor is instructed by\na later client; and the second being where a solicitor in possession of a client\u2019s confidential information subsequently becomes employed or engaged in a second firm which\nis acting against the solicitor\u2019s former client, in circumstances in which that information is or might be relevant to the conduct of those proceedings, and there is a risk that\nthe information will be disclosed to those having the conduct of the proceedings. The plaintiff relied only on the third basis for relief, namely that \u201cthe court may intervene\nwhere restraining the solicitor is in the interests of the court exercising proper control over the conduct of an officer of the court\u201d [47].\n71 After reference to Williamson v Nilant, Hasluck J focussed the test on the independence and objectivity of the solicitor [at [53]]:-\nThe most obvious case in that regard would be a situation in which a solicitor had some direct pecuniary interest in the outcome. It might seem to an independent observer\nthat a solicitor, notwithstanding his best efforts to be impartial and objective, might adjust his evidence in some way to procure a result that suited his interest. The decided\ncases suggest also that the same principles apply in circumstances where a solicitor might feel impelled to justify or defend his conduct in representing a client,\nnotwithstanding that the solicitor did not have any specific pecuniary interest in the outcome other than the obtaining of his professional fees.\n72 His Honour added observations to the effect that the exercise of the power must be regarded as exceptional; that it was generally undesirable for a practitioner aware\nthat he was likely to be called as a witness other than in relation to formal or non-contentious issues to continue to represent the client; that a clear case should be required\nthat the practitioner in question is fixed with an interest conflicting with his duty to the court, but that if a practitioner\u2019s credibility is at stake as a witness so that his or her\npersonal integrity may be put in issue, that may constitute a personal interest inconsistent with the practitioner\u2019s duty to the court or to the client; and that the cost,\ninconvenience or even impracticality of a firm ceasing to act may provide a reason for refusing to grant relief, due weight being required to be given the public interest that a\nlitigant should not without good cause be deprived of his or her choice of counsel.\n73 In Sent v John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited [2002] VSC 429, Nettle J noted that Brooking JA\u2019s observations in Spincode appeared to have taken the law further than\nin England or New South Wales, but indicated that if it were necessary to decide, he would follow Brooking JA.\n74 In Asia Pacific Telecommunications, Bergin J declined to restrain solicitors from further acting for the defendant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f609cb98-0ca9-4635-a0a2-7cda214c0d1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f609cb98-0ca9-4635-a0a2-7cda214c0d1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a303cc3-71dd-4e49-bcb1-13031961081a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b725a3d0f02012e6d3e75e5417dbe51d33ce5bfe68a126674e7917de5c27219"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b54eb53-e622-4936-a31c-d7823eaf9317", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b09b6ee742d9e2413dea3f369ec0706a4b6ae6a051c82fad1136fb6d9d26e0b3"}}, "hash": "b5d0a68ea415093b576b84b93c781b2e09850f7870f3b38d2faac04992d5a89a", "text": "The plaintiff\u2019s claim was advanced first on the basis of\nprotection of confidential information provided to the solicitors in the course of another retainer, secondly on the basis of breach of an obligation of loyalty arising from that\nother retainer, and thirdly on the basis of public policy. In respect of the duty of loyalty, her Honour reviewed Spincode, Sent and the decisions of Young CJ in Eq in Belan v\nCasey and British American Tobacco. Pointing out that the delivery of legal services nowadays takes place in an environment which has changed markedly from that which\nprevailed when the rules governing when Courts would restrain solicitors from acting emerged - there now being a statutory regime as to the conduct of legal practitioners,\na statutory complaints authority, and many layers of conduct committees within professional organisations, so that the court is no longer the only \u201cregulator\u201d of the conduct\nof legal practitioners, her Honour thought that prior to Prince Jefri, confusion emanated from the blurring of the line between the court\u2019s \u201csupervision of its officers\u201d on the\none hand, and the entitlement to have the courts intervene to protect the equitable right to confidence on the other, and that with regard to solicitors acting against former\nclients, the line between disciplinary supervision and consideration of the entitlement to injunctive relief for the protection of confidential information and/or for breach of\nduty was now best accommodated by the approach taken in Prince Jefri and adopted by the Court of Appeal in Beach Petroleum NL v Abbott Tout Russell Kennedy [1999]\nNSWCA 408; (1999) 48 NSWLR 1, and by Young CJ in Eq in Belan v Casey, and in British American Tobacco.\n75 However, her Honour added \u201cThe court\u2019s jurisdiction over its officers is of course accepted both as to its existence and its breadth\u201d\n. Accordingly, I take her Honour\u2019s\npreference for Belan v Casey and British American Tobacco over the Victorian cases to be addressed to the supposed duty of loyalty, rather than to the supervisory\njurisdiction. This is reinforced by the circumstance that her Honour then proceeded separately to examine the public policy question, with reference inter alia to Grimwade v\nMeagher (and without any hint of disapproval), applying the objective test mentioned repeatedly above by concluding that, in that case, a fair-minded, reasonably informed\nmember of the public would conclude that the administration of justice was not adversely affected in the circumstances.\n76 The foregoing authorities establish the following:-\n\u00b7 During the subsistence of a retainer, where the court\u2019s intervention to restrain a solicitor from acting for another is sought by an existing client of the solicitor, the\nfoundation of the court\u2019s jurisdiction is the fiduciary obligation of a solicitor, and the inescapable conflict of duty which is inherent in the situation of acting for clients with\ncompeting interests [Prince Jefri].\n\u00b7 Once the retainer is at an end, however, the court\u2019s jurisdiction is not based on any conflict of duty or interest, but on the protection of the confidences of the former client\n(unless there is no real risk of disclosure) [Prince Jefri].\n\u00b7 After termination of the retainer, there is no continuing (equitable or contractual) duty of loyalty to provide a basis for the court\u2019s intervention, such duty having come to an\nend with the retainer [Prince Jefri; Belan v Casey; Photocure; British American Tobacco; Asia Pacific Telecommunications; contra Spincode; McVeigh; Sent].\n\u00b7 However, the court always has inherent jurisdiction to restrain solicitors from acting in a particular case, as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction over its officers and to\ncontrol its process in aid of the administration of justice [Everingham v Ontario; Black v Taylor; Grimwade v Meagher; Newman v Phillips Fox; Mitchell v Pattern Holdings;\nSpincode; Holborow; Williamson v Nilant; Bowen v Stott; Law Society v Holt]. Prince Jefri does not address this jurisdiction at all. Belan v Casey and British American\nTobacco are not to be read as supposing that Prince Jefri excludes it. Asia Pacific Telecommunications appears to acknowledge its continued existence.\n\u00b7 The test to be applied in this inherent jurisdiction is whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of\njustice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration\nof justice, including the appearance of justice [Everingham v Ontario; Black v Taylor; Grimwade v Meagher; Holborow; Bowen v Stott; Asia Pacific Telecommunications].", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b54eb53-e622-4936-a31c-d7823eaf9317": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b54eb53-e622-4936-a31c-d7823eaf9317", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "f609cb98-0ca9-4635-a0a2-7cda214c0d1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5d0a68ea415093b576b84b93c781b2e09850f7870f3b38d2faac04992d5a89a"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf9fabd0-04b9-4f00-a029-5d184dde4d85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9f6037a249eea187dd3de5ee84f7592e55880a9491be29ab07db879901d7142"}}, "hash": "b09b6ee742d9e2413dea3f369ec0706a4b6ae6a051c82fad1136fb6d9d26e0b3", "text": "\u00b7 The jurisdiction is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution [Black v Taylor; Grimwade v Meagher; Bowen v Stott].\n\u00b7 Due weight should be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of the lawyer of his or her choice without due cause [Black v Taylor; Grimwade v Meagher;\nWilliamson v Nilant; Bowen v Stott].\n\u00b7 The timing of the application may be relevant, in that the cost, inconvenience or impracticality of requiring lawyers to cease to act may provide a reason for refusing to\ngrant relief [Black v Taylor; Bowen v Stott].\nResolution\n77 Mr Ireland submitted that it would be a serious prejudgment of Mr Moloney\u2019s role to restrain him from acting at this stage. He suggested that the more likely explanation\nfor the distribution of the balance proceeds of sale apparently in favour of Mr Hunt\u2019s interests was that the plaintiffs had in fact given their authority to Mr Hunt to so direct\nMr Moloney. Though conceding that Mr Moloney might be a relevant witness, who either party might call, he submitted that it was too early to tell.\n78 I am unable to accept this submission. I do not overlook Mr Ireland\u2019s submission that it would be a serious prejudgment of Mr Moloney\u2019s role to restrain him from acting\nat this stage, and I make no judgment at all about Mr Moloney\u2019s role, but I have to make a judgment about the likelihood of his being a material witness or having an interest\nin the outcome. Mr Ireland concedes that there is a live issue as to whether or not Mr Hunt was authorised on behalf of Mr Kallinicos to give directions to Mr Moloney in\nrespect of the sales after the alleged termination date. Mr Ireland also concedes that Mr Moloney might be a material witness (though, he submits, not that he might be\nexposed to suit). For the reasons which follow, I have come to the conclusion that not only is he almost certainly a material witness, but depending on how the evidence\nturns out as to how the directions to the purchasers\u2019 solicitors were given, he might well be exposed to suit, and he has an interest in how the evidence turns out.\n79 There is going to be an examination of the circumstances surrounding the application of the balance proceeds of sale to which Rowntree was entitled from the sale of\nunits 3, 11, 12 and 13 and, in particular, why apparently the whole of the surplus proceeds after payment of adjustments and costs and discharge of mortgages was paid to\nMr Hunt\u2019s entities to the exclusion of Mr Kallinicos. There will be an important issue in the case as to what instructions were given for the disbursement of the balance\nproceeds of sale and by whom. It is common ground that Mr Moloney acted for Rowntree on each of those sales. The letter directing payment of settlement moneys was in\neach case signed by or on behalf of Mr Moloney. It may reasonably be inferred that Mr Moloney has knowledge, or the means of knowledge, as to the instructions which\nresulted in those directions being given. Mr Moloney is almost certainly a material witness on that issue.\n80 Further, it is clear that at relevant times Mr Moloney was on notice (from Konstan\u2019s letter of 9 November 2001) that Mr Kallinicos claimed to have terminated the\npartnership and was demanding accounts and payment of his share of the partnership assets. There will be an issue as to whether he ought to have been alerted to the\nposition of Mr Kallinicos by the form of execution and attestation of the four transfers. There will also be an issue as to how the funds came to be so disbursed, when Mr\nMoloney was prima facie on notice of the dissolution of the partnership. Mr Moloney is likely to be a material witness on that issue, and it may be inferred that there will be a\nchallenge to his conduct in that respect.\n81 There are a number of hypothetical possibilities. One, as Mr Ireland posits, is that Mr Kallinicos in fact authorised Mr Hunt to deal with the proceeds in the manner in\nwhich they were applied. But as Mr Ireland acknowledged, there is a live issue as to authority; and Mr Kallinicos disputes that he gave any such authority, which only serves\nto highlight the centrality of Mr Moloney's evidence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf9fabd0-04b9-4f00-a029-5d184dde4d85": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf9fabd0-04b9-4f00-a029-5d184dde4d85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b54eb53-e622-4936-a31c-d7823eaf9317", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b09b6ee742d9e2413dea3f369ec0706a4b6ae6a051c82fad1136fb6d9d26e0b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bd14a86-70dd-4e59-ab27-51d5652f09e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d2514e981c12586bd07fd1e25b0f37212981f67b5bed6de6d8e3b0f0de1ade1"}}, "hash": "b9f6037a249eea187dd3de5ee84f7592e55880a9491be29ab07db879901d7142", "text": "82 A second would be that having forwarded the transfers to Mr Hunt for execution, Mr Moloney received instructions from Mr Hunt (which Mr Moloney believed, but which\nwere in fact false) that they had been duly executed, and that Mr Hunt and Mr Kallinicos were agreed as to the directions as to payment. Even that leaves open the\nlikelihood of a complaint that Mr Moloney should have obtained instructions directly from Mr Kallinicos in those circumstances when on notice of the dissolution of the\npartnership. And evidence (by Mr Moloney) that Mr Hunt had given such instructions, if contrary to the fact, would be important evidence against Mr Hunt.\n83 A third possible explanation is that despite knowledge of the interest of Mr Kallinicos, Mr Moloney cooperated or acquiesced in the diversion of Mr Kallinicos\u2019 entitlement\nto Mr Hunt. In that event, Mr Moloney might be in the position of potential accessorial liability under Barnes v Addy (1874) LR 9 Ch App 244; (1874) 43 LJ Ch 513; (1874) 30\nLT 4; (1874) 22 WR 505. Mr Moloney\u2019s evidence would be both an important material witness, and an interested party, in that event.\n84 Accordingly, in my opinion, Mr Moloney will be a material witness on issues of substance which appear to be controversial and in respect of which questions of\ncredibility and integrity (not necessarily his own) are likely to arise.\n85 Moreover, there is a high degree of probability that Mr Moloney\u2019s evidence and/or conduct will come under scrutiny. It seems almost inevitable that Mr Kallinicos would\nquery how being on notice of the interest and claims of Mr Kallinicos, Mr Moloney could accept instructions to distribute the entire balance of proceeds for the benefit of Mr\nHunt. There may be a perfectly good explanation, but one can anticipate that it will be the subject of rigorous testing.\n86 Thus, the propriety of Mr Moloney\u2019s conduct is likely to be examined in the proceedings, and his evidence is likely to be material. He will be in a position in which his\nclient's interest, his own interest, and his obligation to the Court may well be in conflict. Mr Moloney will owe obligations of loyalty to his present client Mr Hunt, he will have\nan interest in presenting the facts in a manner which exonerates himself, and he will have a duty to the court to be frank. His evidence may crucially corroborate or refute Mr\nHunt\u2019s version, and his own position and conduct may come under scrutiny. Yet Mr Moloney would not likely be called in Mr Hunt\u2019s case to prove that Mr Hunt had given\nfalse instructions. If he continues to act, loyalty to his client would be a disincentive to give evidence if those were the circumstances. Yet failure to give evidence would\nresult in submissions being made that his evidence would not have assisted his own client\u2019s case.\n87 It is generally undesirable for a practitioner who is aware that he is likely to be called as a witness, other than in relation to formal or non-contentious issues, to continue\nto act. If a practitioner\u2019s credibility is at stake as a witness, his personal integrity may be put in issue and that may constitute a personal interest inconsistent with the\npractitioner\u2019s duty to the court or to the client. In those circumstances, it is relevant though far from decisive to note that the Revised Professional Conduct and Practice\nRules 1995 provide as follows:-\n19. A practitioner must not appear as an advocate and, unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying the practitioner\u2019s continuing retainer by the practitioner\u2019s client,\nthe practitioner must not act, or continue to act, in a case in which it is known, or becomes apparent, that the practitioner will be required to give evidence material to the\ndetermination of contested issues before the court.\n88 In Bowen v Stott, the ultimate issue was whether a settlement had been concluded of earlier proceedings, and counsel and a solicitor who claimed to have negotiated\nthe settlement on behalf of their client swore affidavits to that effect. For the plaintiff, it was argued that counsel and solicitor were bound to end up giving evidence in\nrespect of contentious matters; that the defendants\u2019 case depended on their evidence; and that it might strike an independent observer that counsel and solicitor were\nnecessarily compelled to present their evidence in a light which would assert that a settlement was arrived at, so that an independent observer might think that the\ndefendants\u2019 legal advisors understandably desired to ensure that the settlement that they said had been negotiated was upheld \u2013 otherwise the events might be thought to\nbear upon their competence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bd14a86-70dd-4e59-ab27-51d5652f09e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bd14a86-70dd-4e59-ab27-51d5652f09e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf9fabd0-04b9-4f00-a029-5d184dde4d85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9f6037a249eea187dd3de5ee84f7592e55880a9491be29ab07db879901d7142"}, "3": {"node_id": "98967455-68a2-45e0-9e02-eb9794fac3b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae7d315cc0155094afd4f29da328a0e9e370da81b59a15d8753e10707f37518a"}}, "hash": "9d2514e981c12586bd07fd1e25b0f37212981f67b5bed6de6d8e3b0f0de1ade1", "text": "For the defendants, it was submitted that the evidence of counsel and solicitor was uncontroverted, and the only relevant matter in dispute\nwas whether on the facts an enforceable compromise was reached, there being no dispute on the evidence as to what took place. It was argued that the lawyers were\nwitnesses as to non-contentious issues, and that as a result no basis for an injunction arose; alternatively, that proceedings were so far advanced that their involvement\ncould not reasonably be avoided. Hasluck J noted that if the pleadings were amended as proposed and the matter proceeded to trial, there would be an evidentiary issue\nas to whether a settlement was effected, and it would be likely that evidence would be required from the solicitor and counsel in question on that issue. It would be almost\ninevitable that they would be challenged about the relevant events, and there would be a contentious issue as to whether agreement was reached on certain matters.\nHasluck J concluded that a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public might think that there was a conflict of interest which might interfere with the proper\nadministration of justice, because counsel and solicitor might not be able to conduct themselves with proper objectivity. For that reason, his Honour granted an injunction.\n89 In Holborow, Keenan J remarked that it had long been accepted that a legal practitioner who was likely to be a witness should not act as counsel or continue as counsel\nif a situation arises where he is unexpected required to give evidence, since the personal integrity of the practitioner may be put in issue if his word or credibility is at stake\nas a witness, and that will or may constitute a personal interest inconsistent with the practitioner\u2019s duty to the court or to the client. Similar conflicts of interest can arise if,\nfor example, the counsel or solicitor had a substantial personal stake in the litigation such as, for example, if he or she were to be a partner in a firm which was a party to\nthe litigation, or a substantial shareholder in a corporation which was a party [Holborow, [29]].\n90 In my opinion a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the independent objectivity of Mr Moloney as solicitor and/or witness was\ncompromised by conflicts between his obligation of loyalty to his client Mr Hunt, his role and knowledge as a witness of material facts, and his potential personal interest.\nAlthough I do not think that fair-minded and reasonably informed members of the public conceive that legal representatives are entirely impartial, as most would see them\nas aligned with the parties whom they represent, and while it needs be borne in mind that the alternative to legal representation is self representation, in which case none of\nthe controls which legal representation imposes on the conduct of litigation would apply, nonetheless, fair-minded and reasonably informed members of the public expect\nthat lawyers will provide advice to their clients, and conduct litigation in which they act, free of and unaffected by any personal interest in the outcome.\n91 I have taken into account the circumstance that Mr Moloney would not be the sole legal representative for the defendants: senior and junior counsel have been retained,\nand the court can have confidence that appropriate independent judgments will be made in the conduct of the defence. I have also taken into account that the concerns\nwhich might be entertained as to the objectivity of Mr Moloney\u2019s evidence will not evaporate if he ceases to act for the defendants, nor would he thereupon become a\nwitness available to all parties - his obligations to Mr Hunt will continue to require him to keep confidential, and treat as privileged, communications between him and Mr\nHunt, and it cannot be anticipated that he will feel free to discuss them with those acting for Mr Kallinicos. It follows that requiring Mr Moloney to cease to act is not a\npanacea for all the associated difficulties. But ultimately these considerations are not weighty: they do not alter the fundamental problem, that the fair-minded reasonably\ninformed observer would think that Mr Moloney\u2019s independence and objectivity as a solicitor would be comprised. The scrutiny which Mr Moloney\u2019s conduct will attract,\nand his knowledge of the instructions for the disbursement of the proceeds of the relevant units, means that in the context of this case, fair-minded members of the public\nwould perceive Mr Moloney as not being able, however well intentioned, to advise his client and conduct the proceedings free of and unaffected by the impact of personal\ninterest. In my opinion, therefore, fair-minded, reasonably informed members of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that Mr Moloney\nnot act for the defendants in these proceedings.\n92 The inherent jurisdiction is discretionary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98967455-68a2-45e0-9e02-eb9794fac3b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "98967455-68a2-45e0-9e02-eb9794fac3b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be85666348475cbb975552e70712e81a86ffc1415b4a5810d85f4225e4d2e8b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "7bd14a86-70dd-4e59-ab27-51d5652f09e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d2514e981c12586bd07fd1e25b0f37212981f67b5bed6de6d8e3b0f0de1ade1"}}, "hash": "ae7d315cc0155094afd4f29da328a0e9e370da81b59a15d8753e10707f37518a", "text": "92 The inherent jurisdiction is discretionary.

Mr\nIreland submitted that the defendants would be prejudiced by such an order at this stage, since Mr Moloney had acquired knowledge of the matter over the period of more\nthan two years that it had taken the plaintiffs to deliver a proper statement of claim. He submitted that the plaintiffs were in effect trying to head off all the progress which\nhad so far been made in getting the case into order. He pointed to the circumstance that the plaintiffs must have known about the allegedly forged signatures in 2002 (which\ndate appears on their searches).\n93 However, the proceedings are at a relatively early stage. Although they have been on foot since 8 January 2003, a defence has not yet been filed; to date the parties\nhave litigated procedural issues concerning pleadings and particulars. While an injunction restraining Mr Moloney from acting for the defendants would no doubt occasion\nsome inconvenience, there is ample time for alternative representation to be obtained; the loss of Mr Moloney\u2019s knowledge of and familiarity with the matter to date would\nnot be oppressive; and the proceedings are not so advanced that a requirement to obtain other representation would be unduly disruptive.\n94 As to the question of delay, the most important material came from Mr Moloney\u2019s files, which were produced only in July 2005. Although the retainer issue about P&K\nwas evident from an early date, its only consequence would have been to leave the fourth defendant unrepresented, and it did not have the same significance in terms of\nrequiring a response in the interests of the administration of justice, as did the appearance of material which would make Mr Moloney a relevant and material witness.\n95 Accordingly, although the prima facie right of a party to be represented by the lawyer of his or her choice is an important one, this is a case in which it should succumb\nto the higher interests of the administration of justice, and relevant discretionary considerations do not significantly weigh against that result.\n96 As the jurisdiction invoked involves the court\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction over its solicitors, the appropriate order is one directed to Mr Moloney, and as he appeared by\ncounsel to oppose the application, it is he who should bear the costs.\n97 I make the following orders:\n1. Order that Patrick Moloney cease to act as solicitor for the defendants herein.\n2. Order that Patrick Moloney pay the plaintiff\u2019s costs of the application.\n**********\nLAST UPDATED: 22/11/2005", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3734c18-3e6a-4f74-b57c-ffeb6d62f22d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3734c18-3e6a-4f74-b57c-ffeb6d62f22d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "3": {"node_id": "b4b5817a-a2cb-4535-bc25-362f40a2659a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b076feb45ef9318654997e47fb3b2f2185bcc7e39e0997045fcf755cb2ca6dc"}}, "hash": "004bbb820e2627b96db9a79d93bb1b8a665582ada07e261a6085d2d0b0119ad6", "text": "What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\n\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\n\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.\n\nThough I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4b5817a-a2cb-4535-bc25-362f40a2659a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4b5817a-a2cb-4535-bc25-362f40a2659a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3734c18-3e6a-4f74-b57c-ffeb6d62f22d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "004bbb820e2627b96db9a79d93bb1b8a665582ada07e261a6085d2d0b0119ad6"}, "3": {"node_id": "e07ead2b-a8bc-47fa-a55e-5a45beeaba20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b62c84f68b7daada0a2d1b63d00eb66a1df7066f4c4f2bc89e0bbdb99b374f9d"}}, "hash": "2b076feb45ef9318654997e47fb3b2f2185bcc7e39e0997045fcf755cb2ca6dc", "text": "All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief \u2014 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 \u2014 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\n\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory \u2014 indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves \u2014 but building things seemed so much more exciting.\n\nThe problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.\n\nThere were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one.

No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.\n\nI wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.\n\nIn this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding.\n\nI had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art \u2014 that it didn't just appear spontaneously \u2014 but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.\n\nThat fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\n\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\n\nI didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\n\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"\n\nI picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\n\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.\n\nToward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply.

In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. [2]\n\nI'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.\n\nOur model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\n\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]\n\nI liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.\n\nOur teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e653b66c-321f-47d4-b66a-ffabbc6c35ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "e653b66c-321f-47d4-b66a-ffabbc6c35ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "19c6c40e-32f1-4bfe-a04d-52d7a48dd3cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "049b65d4cb81322389004276c46516d48f7606267c872d79b450c94927a40dd0"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5e1dece-0e86-4f5b-9e08-aef81b6b03b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "64fce3dbb8151fcd6ba49f7a4f0b26677a288b7170cffc16c8dfedf8c53874a2"}}, "hash": "6195ecb69ddddf7817842b546e8f7ad2ac357be2b3d4864a1512b6845ab7f83b", "text": "I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]\n\nInterleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.\n\nThe good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.\n\nI learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n\nBut the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.\n\nIn the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.\n\nA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5e1dece-0e86-4f5b-9e08-aef81b6b03b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5e1dece-0e86-4f5b-9e08-aef81b6b03b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "e653b66c-321f-47d4-b66a-ffabbc6c35ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6195ecb69ddddf7817842b546e8f7ad2ac357be2b3d4864a1512b6845ab7f83b"}, "3": {"node_id": "fca872a3-5bcc-48d3-b55d-cb4695f9d579", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c25f799adbe11febeb9dccd9fb91a841870495a31a313beaa3496c86d173d06f"}}, "hash": "64fce3dbb8151fcd6ba49f7a4f0b26677a288b7170cffc16c8dfedf8c53874a2", "text": "That's not always why artists have a signature style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]\n\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]\n\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist \u2014 in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.\n\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fca872a3-5bcc-48d3-b55d-cb4695f9d579": {"__data__": {"id_": "fca872a3-5bcc-48d3-b55d-cb4695f9d579", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5e1dece-0e86-4f5b-9e08-aef81b6b03b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "64fce3dbb8151fcd6ba49f7a4f0b26677a288b7170cffc16c8dfedf8c53874a2"}, "3": {"node_id": "68f4a442-d40f-42ea-829d-59cd6b9d8baf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d2f30335826366840a43ccf6a2b1cb0405c7bb28d48d129a36657bfbea94618"}}, "hash": "c25f799adbe11febeb9dccd9fb91a841870495a31a313beaa3496c86d173d06f", "text": "So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores \u2014 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve them from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.\n\nAt this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.\n\nWe originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.\n\nIt helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.\n\n(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because it's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)\n\nIn September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.\n\nIt was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor.

If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.\n\nWe opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\n\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.\n\nThere were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\n\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.\n\nWe learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.\n\nThough this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.\n\nAnother thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.\n\nAlas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble.

So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.\n\nIt was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.\n\nThe next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.\n\nYahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\n\nWhen I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.\n\nBut I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.\n\nSo I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't know any of them.\n\nWhen I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while.

Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).\n\nMeanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one. Huh.\n\nAround this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.\n\nI got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.\n\nHmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\n\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.\n\nI started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company \u2014 especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset that could be done as an open source project.\n\nMuch to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.\n\nThe subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot.

If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.\n\nThis had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]\n\nIn the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]\n\nI've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.\n\nI knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.\n\nIt's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.\n\nOver the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.\n\nOne night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.\n\nJessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\n\nWhen the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0424bbdc-5aeb-4c37-aa58-acf5b489d2c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0424bbdc-5aeb-4c37-aa58-acf5b489d2c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "727341dc-4660-41cc-8572-b86671672155", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed45a2799fb77a8dec5fa517bb07a3bbb557fdc1697c370b3cebd2ac68122078"}, "3": {"node_id": "85ee4ca0-bf85-4747-9b82-f4eff01d47cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0eefb0dcecc1bcb6a8dd0fa15b519f03fd2b196a7a4c56bb0aa85b4b56f8631"}}, "hash": "475503bdd5875b1d25215dd720f9163208df657e42a9202cbeb098066dc98a76", "text": "They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.\n\nOne of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we'd made.\n\nSo I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.\n\nMeanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.\n\nAs Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd been talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]\n\nOnce again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.\n\nThere are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.\n\nYC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn't have known where to start. [14]\n\nThe most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.\n\nWe'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85ee4ca0-bf85-4747-9b82-f4eff01d47cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "85ee4ca0-bf85-4747-9b82-f4eff01d47cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "0424bbdc-5aeb-4c37-aa58-acf5b489d2c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "475503bdd5875b1d25215dd720f9163208df657e42a9202cbeb098066dc98a76"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee083a6b-b0b4-4555-9be5-27a0280ecf5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "35bd588bd3017a4e8db31eccb4a5fd9d19cd2b7ceff8fda2c724a7331c731fa4"}}, "hash": "b0eefb0dcecc1bcb6a8dd0fa15b519f03fd2b196a7a4c56bb0aa85b4b56f8631", "text": "We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We'd all have dinner there once a week \u2014 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays \u2014 and after dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee083a6b-b0b4-4555-9be5-27a0280ecf5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee083a6b-b0b4-4555-9be5-27a0280ecf5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "85ee4ca0-bf85-4747-9b82-f4eff01d47cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0eefb0dcecc1bcb6a8dd0fa15b519f03fd2b196a7a4c56bb0aa85b4b56f8631"}, "3": {"node_id": "06a1f60e-719b-4600-920a-dcb9c2b6d2f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "acda05c4981515197f413f64ebb342a42aa30122949121a35a88941acfbfad7a"}}, "hash": "35bd588bd3017a4e8db31eccb4a5fd9d19cd2b7ceff8fda2c724a7331c731fa4", "text": "[17]\n\nAs well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\n\nYC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.\n\nThere were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard.\n\nOne day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"\n\nAt the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06a1f60e-719b-4600-920a-dcb9c2b6d2f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "06a1f60e-719b-4600-920a-dcb9c2b6d2f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee083a6b-b0b4-4555-9be5-27a0280ecf5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "35bd588bd3017a4e8db31eccb4a5fd9d19cd2b7ceff8fda2c724a7331c731fa4"}, "3": {"node_id": "c76eeea7-3be7-425b-aa3d-cc6bb5eac36e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f81c5879523cd4dccc71acdb9b42dd538a76e18684ddfcacf5d24060694cd87"}}, "hash": "acda05c4981515197f413f64ebb342a42aa30122949121a35a88941acfbfad7a", "text": "(I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.\n\nMcCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\n\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\n\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.\n\nI had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c76eeea7-3be7-425b-aa3d-cc6bb5eac36e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c76eeea7-3be7-425b-aa3d-cc6bb5eac36e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "06a1f60e-719b-4600-920a-dcb9c2b6d2f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "acda05c4981515197f413f64ebb342a42aa30122949121a35a88941acfbfad7a"}, "3": {"node_id": "5827bc99-7cca-42d8-88dc-17a0d191c58b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27627775d75745356c52c6ab390f8cc55a076e8099e0b40d5ac82ddd8291a695"}}, "hash": "0f81c5879523cd4dccc71acdb9b42dd538a76e18684ddfcacf5d24060694cd87", "text": "Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\n\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"\n\nWorking on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5827bc99-7cca-42d8-88dc-17a0d191c58b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5827bc99-7cca-42d8-88dc-17a0d191c58b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c76eeea7-3be7-425b-aa3d-cc6bb5eac36e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f81c5879523cd4dccc71acdb9b42dd538a76e18684ddfcacf5d24060694cd87"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d15519a-7ed8-4837-9084-2b6850453d3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91d3db5770b27e3ef24e25e675501d7b03cc41373042916eef8ccc023869ad59"}}, "hash": "27627775d75745356c52c6ab390f8cc55a076e8099e0b40d5ac82ddd8291a695", "text": "So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.\n\n[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d15519a-7ed8-4837-9084-2b6850453d3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d15519a-7ed8-4837-9084-2b6850453d3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2d9629223c077019a6dde689049344ff2293d6c52372871420119ec049f25c"}, "2": {"node_id": "5827bc99-7cca-42d8-88dc-17a0d191c58b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "27627775d75745356c52c6ab390f8cc55a076e8099e0b40d5ac82ddd8291a695"}}, "hash": "91d3db5770b27e3ef24e25e675501d7b03cc41373042916eef8ccc023869ad59", "text": "[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.\n\nBut if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\n\n\n\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"4d4aa558-1dd9-4a45-bc48-5c4a88c95107": {"node_ids": ["0e7bbd51-d4b0-4546-b304-122a75a8c83d", "7864fd36-f0c8-4a22-b726-265982b4e15f", "1ec8e1fa-7611-44c0-b8c2-f31332defce3", "3a5eedd3-493f-4291-8003-481967be74fc", "384de575-b185-4cd9-b9a5-f7339dbc561b", "7a139754-0afe-495e-a447-2ad8f84f3cb9", "71500d4a-f42b-4276-8f76-6823633ee299", "5771fe94-3042-4027-acd5-e6471dcdba8f", "d2d5935c-5460-428d-9853-7000f5ff6a82", "ea9d7a97-02e5-4f1c-805b-265ae3497f6b", "76c07563-0d3f-4a6b-b7aa-03a10fc6cebf", "f9450513-19bf-44c6-8312-b39de12aae4e", "a5d09e55-1ba8-4f59-a142-dad29479b4ac", "d1a412a3-721e-4470-a822-caae3fdc865b", "53a95430-48d2-4982-976e-c9c704f45eaf", "9f7c46cb-3e2f-469e-827c-7ae8b7660bfe", "af959697-502a-405c-bc3c-44837832bf1f", "0e4fccb8-965c-4606-a4a5-4888e301ad15", "53063341-d803-4997-954f-e26921cfb7d4", "8d5ce367-bee4-41a6-bbaa-bc1f2dea4b62", "edc57552-a17f-44a7-9253-cb7a50a49aba", "835d9076-b494-4e49-b29e-56f891a0a030", "b2024aa0-f635-4bfe-bbfe-9be4c7baf896"], "metadata": {}}, "204e1d0d-e439-42a4-a3f4-b267fc57ce01": {"node_ids": ["502c9438-8d60-448a-b8a8-ba3430418473", "a78e4ab5-2509-402f-96cb-47963d30b349", "ef3ff576-90c7-430c-8f4f-cf2dd37b9a39", "cbf09f1d-660d-495a-8391-266ae04ebbc1", "43366d89-b860-4b5d-9932-625e8f2b13f0", "b5774102-878a-4fcf-a1f6-b7944049c025", "11bf6d34-3efa-4826-b183-6199f4470563", "e0034fbc-a66b-4590-9f60-1bd7ad3f0461", "c8a496e5-e7cc-4200-a9ad-84588a9599f2", "d7852fa7-76d2-4297-bb99-b6d3509dde58", "6c4ee1d0-9652-4a6e-86b9-22b620ba6e53", "9e42011f-e672-4e62-a0c5-f32a64318691", "9db5d0a3-313e-4369-94a0-4e17ba8affd1", "05b73b5d-f22b-4c5d-a79c-bf2f29b9a46a", "83260217-fba5-4cd3-ae38-1b3aa5efc857", "4a303cc3-71dd-4e49-bcb1-13031961081a", "f609cb98-0ca9-4635-a0a2-7cda214c0d1d", "1b54eb53-e622-4936-a31c-d7823eaf9317", "bf9fabd0-04b9-4f00-a029-5d184dde4d85", "7bd14a86-70dd-4e59-ab27-51d5652f09e1", "98967455-68a2-45e0-9e02-eb9794fac3b1"], "metadata": {}}, "b2462821-b28d-4f20-9a82-b3adbe580058": {"node_ids": ["d3734c18-3e6a-4f74-b57c-ffeb6d62f22d", "b4b5817a-a2cb-4535-bc25-362f40a2659a", "e07ead2b-a8bc-47fa-a55e-5a45beeaba20", "19c6c40e-32f1-4bfe-a04d-52d7a48dd3cc", "e653b66c-321f-47d4-b66a-ffabbc6c35ea", "b5e1dece-0e86-4f5b-9e08-aef81b6b03b0", "fca872a3-5bcc-48d3-b55d-cb4695f9d579", "68f4a442-d40f-42ea-829d-59cd6b9d8baf", "3e726e12-4696-4312-9cd4-988121e574ad", "26d7f5e9-2cf5-419c-b72e-1ca1f2d5ce3f", "727341dc-4660-41cc-8572-b86671672155", "0424bbdc-5aeb-4c37-aa58-acf5b489d2c4", "85ee4ca0-bf85-4747-9b82-f4eff01d47cb", "ee083a6b-b0b4-4555-9be5-27a0280ecf5b", "06a1f60e-719b-4600-920a-dcb9c2b6d2f5", "c76eeea7-3be7-425b-aa3d-cc6bb5eac36e", "5827bc99-7cca-42d8-88dc-17a0d191c58b", "1d15519a-7ed8-4837-9084-2b6850453d3c"], "metadata": {}}}}
